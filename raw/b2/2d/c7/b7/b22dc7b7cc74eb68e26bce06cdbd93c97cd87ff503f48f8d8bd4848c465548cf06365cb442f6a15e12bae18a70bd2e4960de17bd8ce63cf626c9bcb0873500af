T* (                     PREFACE TO THE ELECTRONIC EDITION) Tj
T* (    ___________________________________________________________________) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (   Why would an author give away an unlimited number of copies of her book) Tj
T* (   for free?) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (   That's a good question. When `Underground''s researcher, Julian) Tj
T* (   Assange, first suggested releasing an electronic version of the book on) Tj
T* (   the Net for free, I had to stop and think about just that question.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (   I'd spent nearly three years researching, writing and editing the nearly) Tj
T* (   500 pages of `Underground'. Julian had worked thousands of) Tj
T* (   hours doing painstaking research; discovering and cultivating sources,) Tj
T* (   digging with great resourcefulness into obscure databases and legal) Tj
T* (   papers, not to mention providing valuable editorial advice.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (   So why would I give away this carefully ripened fruit for free?) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (   Because part of the joy of creating a piece of art is in knowing that) Tj
T* (   many people can - and are - enjoying it. Particularly people who can't) Tj
T* (   otherwise afford to pay $11 USD for a book. People such as cash strapped) Tj
T* (   hackers. This book is about them, their lives and obsessions. It rubs) Tj
T* (   clear a small circle in the frosted glass so the reader can peer into) Tj
T* (   that hazy world. `Underground' belongs on the Net, in their ephemeral) Tj
T* (   landscape.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (   The critics have been good to `Underground', for which I am very) Tj
T* (   grateful. But the best praise came from two of the hackers detailed in) Tj
T* (   the book. Surprising praise, because while the text is free of the) Tj
T* (   narrative moralising that plague other works, the selection of material) Tj
T* (   is often very personal and evokes mixed sympathies. One of the hackers,) Tj
T* (   Anthrax dropped by my office to say `Hi'. Out of the blue, he said with) Tj
T* (   a note of amazement, `When I read those chapters, it was so real, as if) Tj
T* (   you had been right there inside my head'. Not long after Par, half a) Tj
T* (   world away, and with a real tone of bewildered incredulity in his voice) Tj
T* (   made exactly the same observation. For a writer, it just doesn't get any) Tj
T* (   better than that.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (   By releasing this book for free on the Net, I'm hoping more people) Tj
T* (   will not only enjoy the story of how the international computer) Tj
T* (   underground rose to power, but also make the journey into the minds) Tj
T* (   of hackers involved. When I first began sketching out the book's) Tj
T* (   structure, I decided to go with depth. I wanted the reader to) Tj

T* (   think, 'NOW I understand, because I too was there.' I hope those) Tj
T* (   words will enter your thoughts as you read this electronic book.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (   Michael Hall, a supersmart lawyer on the book's legal team, told me) Tj
T* (   in July last year he saw a young man in Sydney reading a copy of) Tj
T* (   `Underground' beside him on the #380 bus to North Bondi. Michael) Tj
T* (   said he wanted to lean over and proclaim proudly, `I legalled that) Tj
T* (   book!'. Instead, he chose to watch the young man's reactions.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (   The young man was completely absorbed, reading hungrily through his) Tj
T* (   well-worn copy, which he had completely personalised. The pages were) Tj
T* (   covered in highlighter, scrawled margin writing and post-it notes. He) Tj
T* (   had underlined sections and dog-eared pages. If the bus had detoured to) Tj
T* (   Brisbane, he probably wouldn't have noticed.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (   I like that. Call me subversive, but I'm chuffed `Underground' is) Tj
T* (   engaging enough to make people miss bus stops. It makes me happy, and) Tj
T* (   happy people usually want to share.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (   There are other reasons for releasing `Underground' in this format. The) Tj
T* (   electronic version is being donated to the visionary Project Gutenburg,) Tj
T* (   a collection of free electronic books run with missionary zeal by) Tj
T* (   Michael Hart.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (   Project Gutenburg promises to keep old out-of-print books in free) Tj
T* (   ``electronic'' print forever, to bring literature to those who can't) Tj
T* (   afford books, and to brighten the world of the visually) Tj
T* (   impaired. `Underground' isn't out of print -- and long may it remain) Tj
T* (   that way -- but those are laudable goals. I wrote in the `Introduction') Tj
T* (   to the printed edition about my great aunt, a diver and artist who) Tj
T* (   pioneered underwater painting in the 1940s.  She provided me with a kind) Tj
T* (   of inspiration for this book. What I didn't mention is that as a result) Tj
T* (   of macular degeneration in both eyes, she is now blind. She can no) Tj
T* (   longer paint or dive. But she does read - avidly - through `talking) Tj
T* (   books'. She is another reason I decided to release `Underground' in this) Tj
T* (   format.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (   So, now you can download and read the electronic version of) Tj
T* (   `Underground' for free. You can also send the work to your friends for) Tj
T* (   free. Or your enemies. At around a megabyte of plain text each, a few) Tj
T* (   dozen copies of `Underground' make an extremely effective mail bomb.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (   That's a joke, folks, not a suggestion. ;-\)) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (   Like many of the people in this book, I'm not big on rules. Fortunately,) Tj
T* (   there aren't many that come with this electronic version. Don't print) Tj
T* (   the work on paper, CD or any other format, except for your own personal) Tj
T* (   reading pleasure. This includes using the work as teaching material in) Tj
T* (   institutions. You must not alter or truncate the work in any way. You) Tj
T* (   must not redistribute the work for any sort of payment, including) Tj
T* (   selling it on its own or as part of a package. Random House is a) Tj
T* (   friendly place, but as one of the world's largest publishers it has a) Tj
T* (   collection of equally large lawyers. Messing with them will leave you) Tj
T* (   with scars in places that could be hard to explain to any future) Tj
T* (   partner.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (   If you want to do any of these things, please contact me or my literary) Tj
T* (   agents Curtis Brown & Co first. I retain the copyright on the) Tj
T* (   work. Julian Assange designed the elegant layout of this electronic) Tj
T* (   edition, and he retains ownership of this design and layout.) Tj

T* (    The non-simple answer goes more like this:) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (    In chapter 4, Par, one of the principle subjects of this book, is being) Tj
T* (    watched by the Secret Service. He's on the run. He's a wanted) Tj
T* (    fugitive. He's hiding out with another hacker, Nibbler in a motel) Tj
T* (    chalet, Black Mountain, North Carolina. The Secret Service move in.) Tj
T* (    The incident is vital in explaining Par's life on the run and the) Tj
T* (    nature of his interaction with the Secret Service. Yet, just before the) Tj
T* (    final edits of this book were to go the publisher, all the pages) Tj
T* (    relating to the Block Mountain incident were about to be pulled. Why?) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (    Suelette had flown to Tuscon Az where she spent three days) Tj
T* (    interviewing Par. I had spent dozens of hours interviewing Par on) Tj
T* (    the phone and on-line. Par gave both of us extraordinary access to) Tj
T* (    his life. While Par displayed a high degree of paranoia about why) Tj
T* (    events had unfolded in the manner they had, he was consistent,) Tj
T* (    detailed and believable as to the events themselves. He showed) Tj
T* (    very little blurring of these two realities, but we needed to show) Tj
T* (    none at all.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (    During Par's time on the run, the international computer underground) Tj
T* (    was a small and strongly connected place. We had already) Tj
T* (    co-incidentally interviewed half a dozen hackers he had communicated) Tj
T* (    with at various times during his zig-zag flight across America. Suelette) Tj
T* (    also spoke at length to his lead lawyer Richard Rosen, who, after) Tj
T* (    getting the all-clear from Par, was kind enough to send us a copy of) Tj
T* (    the legal brief.  We had logs of messages Par had written on) Tj
T* (    underground BBS's. We had data intercepts of other hackers in) Tj
T* (    conversation with Par. We had obtained various Secret Service documents) Tj
T* (    and propriety security reports relating to Par's activities. I had) Tj
T* (    extensively interviewed his Swiss girlfriend Theorem \(who had also been) Tj
T* (    involved with Electron and Pengo\), and yes, she did have a melting) Tj
T* (    French accent.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (    Altogether we had an enormous amount of material on Par's activities,) Tj
T* (    all of which was consistent with what Par had said during his) Tj
T* (    interviews, but none of it, including Rosen's file, contained any) Tj
T* (    reference to Black Mountain, NC. Rosen, Theorem and others had heard) Tj
T* (    about a SS raid on the run, yet when the story was traced back, it) Tj
T* (    always led to one source. To Par.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (    Was Par having us on? Par had said that he had made a telephone call to) Tj
T* (    Theorem in Switzerland from a phone booth outside the motel a day or) Tj
T* (    two before the Secret Service raid.  During a storm. Not just any) Tj
T* (    storm. Hurricane Hugo. But archival news reports on Hugo discussed it) Tj
T* (    hitting South Carolina, not North Carolina. And not Black) Tj
T* (    Mountain. Theorem remembered Par calling once during a storm. But not) Tj
T* (    Hugo. And she didn't remember it in relation to the Black Mountain) Tj
T* (    raid.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (    Par had destroyed most of his legal documents, in circumstances that) Tj
T* (    become clear in the book, but of the hundreds of pages of documentary) Tj
T* (    material we had obtained from other sources there was wasn't a single) Tj
T* (    mention of Black Mountain.  The Black Mountain Motel didn't seem to) Tj
T* (    exist. Par said Nibbler had moved and couldn't be located.  Dozens of) Tj
T* (    calls by Suelette to the Secret Service told us what we didn't want to) Tj
T* (    hear.  The agents we thought most likely to have been involved in the) Tj
T* (    the hypothetical Black Mountain incident had either left the Secret) Tj
T* (    Service or were otherwise unreachable.  The Secret Service had no idea) Tj

T* (   As a child, I was entranced by her stories of the unknown world below) Tj
T* (   the ocean's surface, and the strange and wonderful cultures she met on) Tj

T* (   canvas the essence of a world utterly foreign to her own.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   New technology--revolutionary for its time--had allowed her to do) Tj

T* (   air hoses running to the surface, human beings were suddenly able to) Tj
T* (   submerge themselves for long periods in an otherwise inaccessible) Tj
T* (   world. New technology allowed her to both venture into this unexplored) Tj
T* (   realm, and to document it in canvas.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   I came upon the brave new world of computer communications and its) Tj
T* (   darker side, the underground, quite by accident. It struck me) Tj
T* (   somewhere in the journey that followed that my trepidations and) Tj
T* (   conflicting desires to explore this alien world were perhaps not) Tj
T* (   unlike my aunt's own desires some half a century before. Like her) Tj
T* (   journey, my own travels have only been made possible by new) Tj
T* (   technologies. And like her, I have tried to capture a small corner of) Tj
T* (   this world.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   This is a book about the computer underground. It is not a book about) Tj
T* (   law enforcement agencies, and it is not written from the point of view) Tj
T* (   of the police officer. From a literary perspective, I have told this) Tj
T* (   story through the eyes of numerous computer hackers. In doing so, I) Tj
T* (   hope to provide the reader with a window into a mysterious, shrouded) Tj
T* (   and usually inaccessible realm.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Who are hackers? Why do they hack? There are no simple answers to) Tj
T* (   these questions. Each hacker is different. To that end, I have) Tj
T* (   attempted to present a collection of individual but interconnected) Tj
T* (   stories, bound by their links to the international computer) Tj
T* (   underground. These are true stories, tales of the world's best and the) Tj
T* (   brightest hackers and phreakers. There are some members of the) Tj
T* (   underground whose stories I have not covered, a few of whom would also) Tj
T* (   rank as world-class. In the end, I chose to paint detailed portraits) Tj
T* (   of a few hackers rather than attempt to compile a comprehensive but) Tj
T* (   shallow catalogue.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   While each hacker has a distinct story, there are common themes which) Tj
T* (   appear throughout many of the stories. Rebellion against all symbols) Tj
T* (   of authority. Dysfunctional families. Bright children suffocated by) Tj
T* (   ill-equipped teachers. Mental illness or instability. Obsession and) Tj
T* (   addiction.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   I have endeavoured to track what happened to each character in this) Tj
T* (   work over time: the individual's hacking adventures, the police raid) Tj
T* (   and the ensuing court case. Some of those court cases have taken years) Tj

T* (   Hackers use `handles'--on-line nicknames--that serve two purposes.) Tj
T* (   They shield the hacker's identity and, importantly, they often make a) Tj
T* (   statement about how the hacker perceives himself in the underground.) Tj
T* (   Hawk, Crawler, Toucan Jones, Comhack, Dataking, Spy, Ripmax, Fractal) Tj
T* (   Insanity, Blade. These are all real handles used in Australia.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In the computer underground, a hacker's handle is his name. For this) Tj
T* (   reason, and because most hackers in this work have now put together) Tj
T* (   new lives for themselves, I have chosen to use only their handles.) Tj
T* (   Where a hacker has had more than one handle, I have used the one he) Tj
T* (   prefers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Each chapter in this book is headed with a quote from a Midnight Oil) Tj
T* (   song which expresses an important aspect of the chapter. The Oilz are) Tj
T* (   uniquely Australian. Their loud voice of protest against the) Tj
T* (   establishment--particularly the military-industrial) Tj
T* (   establishment--echoes a key theme in the underground, where music in) Tj
T* (   general plays a vital role.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The idea for using these Oilz extracts came while researching Chapter) Tj
T* (   1, which reveals the tale of the WANK worm crisis in NASA. Next to the) Tj
T* (   RTM worm, WANK is the most famous worm in the history of computer) Tj
T* (   networks. And it is the first major worm bearing a political message.) Tj
T* (   With WANK, life imitated art, since the term computer `worm' came from) Tj
T* (   John Brunner's sci-fi novel, The Shockwave Rider, about a politically) Tj
T* (   motivated worm.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The WANK worm is also believed to be the first worm written by an) Tj
T* (   Australian, or Australians.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   This chapter shows the perspective of the computer system) Tj
T* (   administrators--the people on the other side from the hackers. Lastly,) Tj
T* (   it illustrates the sophistication which one or more Australian members) Tj
T* (   of the worldwide computer underground brought to their computer) Tj
T* (   crimes.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The following chapters set the scene for the dramas which unfold and) Tj
T* (   show the transition of the underground from its early days, its loss) Tj
T* (   of innocence, its closing ranks in ever smaller circles until it) Tj
T* (   reached the inevitable outcome: the lone hacker. In the beginning, the) Tj
T* (   computer underground was a place, like the corner pub, open and) Tj
T* (   friendly. Now, it has become an ephemeral expanse, where hackers) Tj
T* (   occasionally bump into one another but where the original sense of) Tj
T* (   open community has been lost.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The computer underground has changed over time, largely in response to) Tj
T* (   the introduction of new computer crime laws across the globe and to) Tj
T* (   numerous police crackdowns. This work attempts to document not only an) Tj
T* (   important piece of Australian history, but also to show fundamental) Tj

T* (   has moved further underground.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   NASA's finest minds had wrestled for years with the problem of exactly) Tj

T* (   option. But if Jupiter was a long way from Earth, it was even further) Tj
T* (   from the Sun--778.3 million kilometres to be exact. Galileo would need) Tj
T* (   ridiculously large solar panels to generate enough power for its) Tj
T* (   instruments at such a distance from the Sun. In the end, NASA's) Tj
T* (   engineers decided on a tried if not true earthly energy source:) Tj
T* (   nuclear power.) Tj

T* (   Nuclear power was perfect for space, a giant void free of human life) Tj

T* (   The activists weren't having a bar of it. In the best tradition of) Tj
T* (   modern American conflict resolution, they took their fight to the) Tj
T* (   courts. The coalition of anti-nuclear and other groups believed) Tj
T* (   America's National Aeronautics and Space Administration had) Tj
T* (   underestimated the odds of a plutonium accident and they wanted a US) Tj
T* (   District Court in Washington to stop the launch. The injunction) Tj
T* (   application went in, and the stakes went up. The unprecedented hearing) Tj
T* (   was scheduled just a few days before the launch, which had originally) Tj
T* (   been planned for 12 October.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   For weeks, the protesters had been out in force, demonstrating and) Tj
T* (   seizing media attention. Things had become very heated. On Saturday, 7) Tj
T* (   October, sign-wielding activists fitted themselves out with gas masks) Tj
T* (   and walked around on street corners in nearby Cape Canaveral in) Tj
T* (   protest. At 8 a.m. on Monday, 9 October, NASA started the countdown) Tj
T* (   for the Thursday blast-off. But as Atlantis's clock began ticking) Tj
T* (   toward take-off, activists from the Florida Coalition for Peace and) Tj
T* (   Justice demonstrated at the centre's tourist complex.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   That these protests had already taken some of the shine off NASA's bold) Tj
T* (   space mission was the least of the agency's worries. The real headache) Tj
T* (   was that the Florida Coalition told the media it would `put people on) Tj
T* (   the launchpad in a non-violent protest'.3 The coalition's director,) Tj
T* (   Bruce Gagnon, put the threat in folksy terms, portraying the protesters) Tj
T* (   as the little people rebelling against a big bad government) Tj
T* (   agency. President Jeremy Rivkin of the Foundation on Economic Trends,) Tj
T* (   another protest group, also drove a wedge between `the people' and) Tj
T* (   `NASA's people'. He told UPI, `The astronauts volunteered for this) Tj
T* (   mission. Those around the world who may be the victims of radiation) Tj
T* (   contamination have not volunteered.'4) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But the protesters weren't the only people working the media. NASA) Tj
T* (   knew how to handle the press. They simply rolled out their) Tj
T* (   superstars--the astronauts themselves. These men and women were, after) Tj
T* (   all, frontier heroes who dared to venture into cold, dark space on) Tj
T* (   behalf of all humanity. Atlantis commander Donald Williams didn't hit) Tj
T* (   out at the protesters in a blunt fashion, he just damned them from an) Tj
T* (   aloof distance. `There are always folks who have a vocal opinion about) Tj
T* (   something or other, no matter what it is,' he told an interviewer. `On) Tj
T* (   the other hand, it's easy to carry a sign. It's not so easy to go) Tj
T* (   forth and do something worthwhile.'5) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   NASA had another trump card in the families of the heroes. Atlantis) Tj
T* (   co-pilot Michael McCulley said the use of RTGs, Radioisotope) Tj
T* (   Thermoelectric Generators--the chunks of plutonium in the lead) Tj
T* (   boxes--was a `non-issue'. So much so, in fact, that he planned to have) Tj
T* (   his loved ones at the Space Center when Atlantis took off.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Maybe the astronauts were nutty risk-takers, as the protesters) Tj
T* (   implied, but a hero would never put his family in danger. Besides the) Tj
T* (   Vice-President of the United States, Dan Quayle, also planned to watch) Tj
T* (   the launch from inside the Kennedy Space Center control room, a mere) Tj
T* (   seven kilometres from the launchpad.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   While NASA looked calm, in control of the situation, it had beefed up) Tj
T* (   its security teams. It had about 200 security guards watching the) Tj
T* (   launch site. NASA just wasn't taking any chances. The agency's) Tj
T* (   scientists had waited too long for this moment. Galileo's parade would) Tj
T* (   not be rained on by a bunch of peaceniks.) Tj

T* (   again, to May 1986. The 1986 Challenger disaster, however, saw NASA) Tj
T* (   change Galileo's booster system for safety reasons, resulting in) Tj
T* (   yet more delays.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The best option seemed to be a two-stage, solid-fuel IUS system. There) Tj
T* (   was only one problem. That system could get Galileo to Mars or Venus,) Tj
T* (   but the probe would run out of fuel long before it got anywhere near) Tj
T* (   Jupiter. Then Roger Diehl of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory had a good) Tj
T* (   idea. Loop Galileo around a couple of nearby planets a few times so the) Tj
T* (   probe would build up a nice little gravitational head of steam, and then) Tj
T* (   fling it off to Jupiter. Galileo's `VEEGA') Tj

T* (   Galileo experienced other delays getting off the ground. On Monday, 9) Tj
T* (   October, NASA announced it had discovered a problem with the computer) Tj
T* (   which controlled the shuttle's number 2 main engine. True, the problem) Tj
T* (   was with Atlantis, not Galileo. But it didn't look all that good to be) Tj
T* (   having technical problems, let alone problems with engine computers,) Tj
T* (   while the anti-nuclear activists' court drama was playing in the) Tj
T* (   background.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   NASA's engineers debated the computer problem in a cross-country) Tj
T* (   teleconference. Rectifying it would delay blast-off by more than a few) Tj
T* (   hours. It would likely take days. And Galileo didn't have many of) Tj
T* (   those. Because of the orbits of the different planets, the probe had) Tj
T* (   to be on its way into space by 21 November. If Atlantis didn't take off) Tj
T* (   by that date, Galileo would have to wait another nineteen months before) Tj
T* (   it could be launched. The project was already $1 billion over its) Tj
T* (   original $400 million budget.  The extra year and a half would add) Tj
T* (   another $130 million or so and there was a good chance the whole project) Tj
T* (   would be scrapped. It was pretty much now or never for Galileo.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Despite torrential downpours which had deposited 100 millimetres of) Tj
T* (   rain on the launchpad and 150 millimetres in neighbouring Melbourne,) Tj
T* (   Florida, the countdown had been going well. Until now. NASA took its) Tj
T* (   decision. The launch would be delayed by five days, to 17 October, so) Tj

T* (   On 16 October McMahon arrived at the office and settled into work,) Tj
T* (   only to face a surprising phone call from the SPAN project office.) Tj
T* (   Todd Butler and Ron Tencati, from the National Space Science Data) Tj
T* (   Center, which managed NASA's half of the SPAN network, had discovered) Tj
T* (   something strange and definitely unauthorised winding its way through) Tj
T* (   the computer network. It looked like a computer worm.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A computer worm is a little like a computer virus. It invades computer) Tj
T* (   systems, interfering with their normal functions. It travels along any) Tj
T* (   available compatible computer network and stops to knock at the door of) Tj
T* (   systems attached to that network. If there is a hole in the security of) Tj
T* (   the computer system, it will crawl through and enter the system. When it) Tj
T* (   does this, it might have instructions to do any number of things, from) Tj
T* (   sending computer users a message to trying to take over the system. What) Tj
T* (   makes a worm different from other computer programs, such as viruses, is) Tj
T* (   that it is self-propagating. It propels itself forward, wiggles into a) Tj
T* (   new system and propagates itself at the new site. Unlike a virus, a worm) Tj
T* (   doesn't latch onto a data file or a program. It is autonomous.7) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The term `worm' as applied to computers came from John Brunner's 1975) Tj
T* (   science fiction classic, The Shockwave Rider. The novel described how) Tj
T* (   a rebel computer programmer created a program called `tapeworm' which) Tj
T* (   was released into an omnipotent computer network used by an autocratic) Tj
T* (   government to control its people. The government had to turn off the) Tj
T* (   computer network, thus destroying its control, in order to eradicate) Tj
T* (   the worm.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Brunner's book is about as close as most VMS computer network managers) Tj
T* (   would ever have come to a real rogue worm. Until the late 1980s, worms) Tj
T* (   were obscure things, more associated with research in a computer) Tj
T* (   laboratory. For example, a few benevolent worms were developed by) Tj
T* (   Xerox researchers who wanted to make more efficient use of computer) Tj
T* (   facilities.8 They developed a `town crier worm' which moved through a) Tj
T* (   network sending out important announcements. Their `diagnostic worm') Tj
T* (   also constantly weaved through the network, but this worm was designed) Tj
T* (   to inspect machines for problems.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   For some computer programmers, the creation of a worm is akin to the) Tj
T* (   creation of life. To make something which is intelligent enough to go) Tj
T* (   out and reproduce itself is the ultimate power of creation. Designing) Tj
T* (   a rogue worm which took over NASA's computer systems might seem to be) Tj
T* (   a type of creative immortality--like scattering pieces of oneself) Tj
T* (   across the computers which put man on the moon.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   At the time the WANK banner appeared on computer screens across NASA,) Tj
T* (   there had only been two rogue worms of any note. One of these, the RTM) Tj
T* (   worm, had infected the Unix-based Internet less than twelve months) Tj
T* (   earlier. The other worm, known as Father Christmas, was the first VMS) Tj
T* (   worm.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Father Christmas was a small, simple worm which did not cause any) Tj
T* (   permanent damage to the computer networks it travelled along. Released) Tj
T* (   just before Christmas in 1988, it tried to sneak into hundreds of VMS) Tj
T* (   machines and wait for the big day. On Christmas morning, it woke up) Tj
T* (   and set to work with great enthusiasm. Like confetti tossed from an) Tj
T* (   overhead balcony, Christmas greetings came streaming out of) Tj
T* (   worm-infested computer systems to all their users. No-one within its) Tj
T* (   reach went without a Christmas card. Its job done, the worm) Tj
T* (   evaporated. John McMahon had been part of the core team fighting off) Tj
T* (   the Father Christmas worm.) Tj

T* (   At about 4 p.m., just a few days before Christmas 1988, McMahon's) Tj
T* (   alarm-monitoring programs began going haywire. McMahon began trying to) Tj
T* (   trace back the dozens of incoming connections which were tripping the) Tj
T* (   warning bells. He quickly discovered there wasn't a human being at the) Tj
T* (   other end of the line. After further investigation, he found an alien) Tj
T* (   program in his system, called HI.COM. As he read the pages of HI.COM) Tj
T* (   code spilling from his line printer, his eyes went wide. He thought,) Tj
T* (   This is a worm! He had never seen a worm before.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He rushed back to his console and began pulling his systems off the) Tj
T* (   network as quickly as possible. Maybe he wasn't following protocol,) Tj
T* (   but he figured people could yell at him after the fact if they thought) Tj
T* (   it was a bad idea. After he had shut down his part of the network, he) Tj
T* (   reported back to the local area networking office. With print-out in) Tj
T* (   tow, he drove across the base to the network office, where he and) Tj
T* (   several other managers developed a way to stop the worm by the end of) Tj
T* (   the day. Eventually they traced the Father Christmas worm back to the) Tj
T* (   system where they believed it had been released--in Switzerland. But) Tj
T* (   they never discovered who created it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Father Christmas was not only a simple worm; it was not considered) Tj
T* (   dangerous because it didn't hang around systems forever. It was a worm) Tj
T* (   with a use-by date.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   By contrast, the SPAN project office didn't know what the WANK invader) Tj
T* (   was capable of doing. They didn't know who had written or launched it.) Tj
T* (   But they had a copy of the program. Could McMahon have a look at it?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   An affable computer programmer with the nickname Fuzzface, John) Tj
T* (   McMahon liked a good challenge. Curious and cluey at the same time, he) Tj
T* (   asked the SPAN Project Office, which was quickly becoming the crisis) Tj
T* (   centre for the worm attack, to send over a copy of the strange) Tj
T* (   intruder. He began pouring over the invader's seven printed pages of) Tj
T* (   source code trying to figure out exactly what the thing did.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The two previous rogue worms only worked on specific computer systems) Tj
T* (   and networks. In this case, the WANK worm only attacked VMS computer) Tj
T* (   systems. The source code, however, was unlike anything McMahon had) Tj
T* (   ever seen. `It was like sifting through a pile of spaghetti,' he said.) Tj
T* (   `You'd pull one strand out and figure, "OK, that is what that thing) Tj
T* (   does." But then you'd be faced with the rest of the tangled mess in) Tj
T* (   the bowl.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The program, in digital command language, or DCL, wasn't written like) Tj
T* (   a normal program in a nice organised fashion. It was all over the) Tj
T* (   place. John worked his way down ten or fifteen lines of computer code) Tj
T* (   only to have to jump to the top of the program to figure out what the) Tj
T* (   next section was trying to do. He took notes and slowly, patiently) Tj
T* (   began to build up a picture of exactly what this worm was capable of) Tj
T* (   doing to NASA's computer system.) Tj

T* (   waiting to go off? Who was behind this?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   NASA was working in an information void when it came to WANK. Some) Tj
T* (   staff knew of the protesters' action down at the Space Center, but) Tj
T* (   nothing could have prepared them for this. NASA officials were) Tj
T* (   confident enough about a link between the protests against Galileo and) Tj
T* (   the attack on NASA's computers to speculate publicly that the two were) Tj
T* (   related. It seemed a reasonable likelihood, but there were still) Tj
T* (   plenty of unanswered questions.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Callers coming into the SPAN office were worried. People at the other) Tj
T* (   end of the phone were scared. Many of the calls came from network) Tj
T* (   managers who took care of a piece of SPAN at a specific NASA site, such) Tj
T* (   as the Marshall Space Flight Center. Some were panicking; others spoke) Tj
T* (   in a sort of monotone, flattened by a morning of calls from 25 different) Tj
T* (   hysterical system administrators. A manager could lose his job over) Tj
T* (   something like this.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Most of the callers to the SPAN head office were starved for) Tj
T* (   information. How did this rogue worm get into their computers? Was it) Tj
T* (   malicious? Would it destroy all the scientific data it came into contact) Tj
T* (   with? What could be done to kill it?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   NASA stored a great deal of valuable information on its SPAN) Tj
T* (   computers. None of it was supposed to be classified, but the data on) Tj
T* (   those computers is extremely valuable. Millions of man-hours go into) Tj
T* (   gathering and analysing it. So the crisis team which had formed in the) Tj
T* (   NASA SPAN project office, was alarmed when reports of massive data) Tj
T* (   destruction starting coming in. People were phoning to say that the) Tj
T* (   worm was erasing files.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was every computer manager's worst nightmare, and it looked as) Tj
T* (   though the crisis team's darkest fears were about to be confirmed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Yet the worm was behaving inconsistently. On some computers it would) Tj
T* (   only send anonymous messages, some of them funny, some bizarre and a) Tj
T* (   few quite rude or obscene. No sooner would a user login than a message) Tj
T* (   would flash across his or her screen:) Tj

T* (   particular time, such as midnight. Perhaps an unusual keystroke by an) Tj
T* (   unwitting computer user on those systems which seemed only mildly) Tj
T* (   affected could trigger something in the worm. One keystroke might) Tj
T* (   begin an irreversible chain of commands to erase everything on that) Tj
T* (   system.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The NASA SPAN computer team were in a race with the worm. Each minute) Tj
T* (   they spent trying to figure out what it did, the worm was pushing) Tj
T* (   forward, ever deeper into NASA's computer network. Every hour NASA) Tj
T* (   spent developing a cure, the worm spent searching, probing, breaking) Tj
T* (   and entering. A day's delay in getting the cure out to all the systems) Tj
T* (   could mean dozens of new worm invasions doing God knows what in) Tj
T* (   vulnerable computers. The SPAN team had to dissect this thing) Tj
T* (   completely, and they had to do it fast.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Some computer network managers were badly shaken. The SPAN office) Tj
T* (   received a call from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratories in California,) Tj
T* (   an important NASA centre with 6500 employees and close ties to) Tj
T* (   California Institute of Technology \(Caltech\).) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   JPL was pulling itself off the network.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   This worm was too much of a risk. The only safe option was to isolate) Tj
T* (   their computers. There would be no SPAN DEC-based communications with) Tj
T* (   the rest of NASA until the crisis was under control. This made things) Tj
T* (   harder for the SPAN team; getting a worm exterminating program out to) Tj
T* (   JPL, like other sites which had cut their connection to SPAN, was) Tj
T* (   going to be that much tougher. Everything had to be done over the) Tj
T* (   phone.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Worse, JPL was one of five routing centres for NASA's SPAN computer) Tj
T* (   network. It was like the centre of a wheel, with a dozen spokes) Tj
T* (   branching off--each leading to another SPAN site. All these places,) Tj
T* (   known as tailsites, depended on the lab site for their connections) Tj
T* (   into SPAN. When JPL pulled itself off the network, the tailsites went) Tj
T* (   down too.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was a serious problem for the people in the SPAN office back in) Tj
T* (   Virginia. To Ron Tencati, head of security for NASA SPAN, taking a) Tj
T* (   routing centre off-line was a major issue. But his hands were tied.) Tj
T* (   The SPAN office exercised central authority over the wide area) Tj
T* (   network, but it couldn't dictate how individual field centres dealt) Tj
T* (   with the worm. That was each centre's own decision. The SPAN team) Tj
T* (   could only give them advice and rush to develop a way to poison the) Tj
T* (   worm.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The SPAN office called John McMahon again, this time with a more) Tj
T* (   urgent request. Would he come over to help handle the crisis?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The SPAN centre was only 800 metres away from McMahon's office. His) Tj
T* (   boss, Jerome Bennett, the DECNET protocol manager, gave the nod.) Tj
T* (   McMahon would be on loan until the crisis was under control.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When he got to Building 26, home of the NASA SPAN project office,) Tj
T* (   McMahon became part of a core NASA crisis team including Todd Butler,) Tj

T* (   But as the day wore on, new people from other parts of the US) Tj
T* (   government would join the team.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The worm had spread outside NASA.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It had also attacked the US Department of Energy's worldwide) Tj
T* (   High-Energy Physics' Network of computers. Known as HEPNET, it was) Tj
T* (   another piece of the overall SPAN network, along with Euro-HEPNET and) Tj
T* (   Euro-SPAN. The NASA and DOE computer networks of DEC computers) Tj
T* (   crisscrossed at a number of places. A research laboratory might, for) Tj
T* (   example, need to have access to computers from both HEPNET and NASA) Tj
T* (   SPAN. For convenience, the lab might just connect the two networks.) Tj
T* (   The effect as far as the worm was concerned was that NASA's SPAN and) Tj
T* (   DOE's HEPNET were in fact just one giant computer network, all of) Tj
T* (   which the worm could invade.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The Department of Energy keeps classified information on its) Tj
T* (   computers. Very classified information. There are two groups in DOE:) Tj
T* (   the people who do research on civilian energy projects and the people) Tj
T* (   who make atomic bombs. So DOE takes security seriously, as in `threat) Tj
T* (   to national security' seriously. Although HEPNET wasn't meant to be) Tj
T* (   carrying any classified information across its wires, DOE responded) Tj
T* (   with military efficiency when its computer managers discovered the) Tj
T* (   invader. They grabbed the one guy who knew a lot about computer) Tj
T* (   security on VMS systems and put him on the case: Kevin Oberman.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Like McMahon, Oberman wasn't formally part of the computer security) Tj
T* (   staff. He had simply become interested in computer security and was) Tj
T* (   known in-house as someone who knew about VMS systems and security.) Tj
T* (   Officially, his job was network manager for the engineering department) Tj
T* (   at the DOE-financed Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, or LLNL,) Tj
T* (   near San Francisco.**) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   LLNL conducted mostly military research, much of it for the Strategic) Tj
T* (   Defense Initiative. Many LLNL scientists spent their days designing) Tj
T* (   nuclear arms and developing beam weapons for the Star Wars program.9) Tj
T* (   DOE already had a computer security group, known as CIAC, the Computer) Tj
T* (   Incident Advisory Capability. But the CIAC team tended to be experts) Tj
T* (   in security issues surrounding Unix rather than VMS-based computer) Tj
T* (   systems and networks. `Because there had been very few security) Tj
T* (   problems over the years with VMS,' Oberman concluded, `they had never) Tj
T* (   brought in anybody who knew about VMS and it wasn't something they) Tj
T* (   were terribly concerned with at the time.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The worm shattered that peaceful confidence in VMS computers. Even as) Tj
T* (   the WANK worm coursed through NASA, it was launching an aggressive) Tj
T* (   attack on DOE's Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, near Chicago. It) Tj
T* (   had broken into a number of computer systems there and the Fermilab) Tj
T* (   people were not happy. They called in CIAC, who contacted Oberman with) Tj
T* (   an early morning phone call on 16 October. They wanted him to analyse) Tj
T* (   the WANK worm. They wanted to know how dangerous it was. Most of all,) Tj
T* (   they wanted to know what to do about it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The DOE people traced their first contact with the worm back to 14) Tj
T* (   October. Further, they hypothesised, the worm had actually been) Tj
T* (   launched the day before, on Friday the 13th. Such an inauspicious day) Tj
T* (   would, in Oberman's opinion, have been in keeping with the type of) Tj
T* (   humour exhibited by the creator or creators of the worm.) Tj

T* (   Oberman began his own analysis of the worm, oblivious to the fact that) Tj
T* (   3200 kilometres away, on the other side of the continent, his colleague) Tj
T* (   and acquaintance John McMahon was doing exactly the same thing.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Every time McMahon answered a phone call from an irate NASA system or) Tj
T* (   network manager, he tried to get a copy of the worm from the infected) Tj
T* (   machine. He also asked for the logs from their computer systems. Which) Tj
T* (   computer had the worm come from? Which systems was it attacking from) Tj
T* (   the infected site? In theory, the logs would allow the NASA team to) Tj
T* (   map the worm's trail. If the team could find the managers of those) Tj
T* (   systems in the worm's path, it could warn them of the impending) Tj
T* (   danger. It could also alert the people who ran recently infected) Tj
T* (   systems which had become launchpads for new worm attacks.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   This wasn't always possible. If the worm had taken over a computer and) Tj
T* (   was still running on it, then the manager would only be able to trace) Tj
T* (   the worm backward, not forward. More importantly, a lot of the) Tj
T* (   managers didn't keep extensive logs on their computers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   McMahon had always felt it was important to gather lots of information) Tj
T* (   about who was connecting to a computer. In his previous job, he had) Tj
T* (   modified his machines so they collected as much security information) Tj
T* (   as possible about their connections to other computers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   VMS computers came with a standard set of alarms, but McMahon didn't) Tj
T* (   think they were thorough enough. The VMS alarms tended to send a) Tj
T* (   message to the computer managers which amounted to, `Hi! You just got) Tj
T* (   a network connection from here'. The modified alarm system said, `Hi!) Tj
T* (   You just got a network connection from here. The person at the other) Tj
T* (   end is doing a file transfer' and any other bits and pieces of) Tj
T* (   information that McMahon's computer could squeeze out of the other) Tj
T* (   computer. Unfortunately, a lot of other NASA computer and network) Tj
T* (   managers didn't share this enthusiasm for audit logs. Many did not) Tj
T* (   keep extensive records of who had been accessing their machines and) Tj
T* (   when, which made the job of chasing the worm much tougher.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The SPAN office was, however, trying to keep very good logs on which) Tj
T* (   NASA computers had succumbed to the worm. Every time a NASA manager) Tj
T* (   called to report a worm disturbance, one of the team members wrote) Tj
T* (   down the details with paper and pen. The list, outlining the addresses) Tj
T* (   of the affected computers and detailed notations of the degree of) Tj
T* (   infection, would also be recorded on a computer. But handwritten lists) Tj
T* (   were a good safeguard. The worm couldn't delete sheets of paper.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When McMahon learned DOE was also under attack, he began checking in) Tj
T* (   with them every three hours or so. The two groups swapped lists of) Tj
T* (   infected computers by telephone because voice, like the handwritten) Tj
T* (   word, was a worm-free medium. `It was a kind of archaic system, but on) Tj
T* (   the other hand we didn't have to depend on the network being up,') Tj
T* (   McMahon said. `We needed to have some chain of communications which) Tj
T* (   was not the same as the network being attacked.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A number of the NASA SPAN team members had developed contacts within) Tj
T* (   different parts of DEC through the company's users' society, DECUS.) Tj
T* (   These contacts were to prove very helpful. It was easy to get lost in) Tj
T* (   the bureaucracy of DEC, which employed more than 125000 people, posted) Tj

T* (   It was a colleague the NASA manager chatted with now and again.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   John McMahon's analysis suggested there were three versions of the WANK) Tj
T* (   worm. These versions, isolated from worm samples collected from the) Tj
T* (   network, were very similar, but each contained a few subtle) Tj
T* (   differences. In McMahon's view, these differences could not be explained) Tj
T* (   by the way the worm recreated itself at each site in order to) Tj
T* (   spread. But why would the creator of the worm release different) Tj
T* (   versions? Why not just write one version properly and fire it off? The) Tj
T* (   worm wasn't just one incoming missile; it was a frenzied attack. It was) Tj
T* (   coming from all directions, at all sorts of different levels within) Tj
T* (   NASA's computers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   McMahon guessed that the worm's designer had released the different) Tj
T* (   versions at slightly different times. Maybe the creator released the) Tj
T* (   worm, and then discovered a bug. He fiddled with the worm a bit to) Tj
T* (   correct the problem and then released it again. Maybe he didn't like) Tj
T* (   the way he had fixed the bug the first time, so he changed it a little) Tj
T* (   more and released it a third time.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In northern California, Kevin Oberman came to a different conclusion.) Tj
T* (   He believed there was in fact only one real version of the worm) Tj
T* (   spiralling through HEPNET and SPAN. The small variations in the) Tj
T* (   different copies he dissected seemed to stem from the worm's ability) Tj
T* (   to learn and change as it moved from computer to computer.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   McMahon and Oberman weren't the only detectives trying to decipher the) Tj
T* (   various manifestations of the worm. DEC was also examining the worm,) Tj
T* (   and with good reason. The WANK worm had invaded the corporation's own) Tj
T* (   network. It had been discovered snaking its way through DEC's own) Tj
T* (   private computer network, Easynet, which connected DEC manufacturing) Tj
T* (   plants, sales offices and other company sites around the world. DEC) Tj
T* (   was circumspect about discussing the matter publicly, but the Easynet) Tj
T* (   version of the WANK worm was definitely distinct. It had a strange) Tj
T* (   line of code in it, a line missing from any other versions. The worm) Tj
T* (   was under instructions to invade as many sites as it could, with one) Tj
T* (   exception. Under no circumstances was it to attack computers inside) Tj
T* (   DEC's area 48. The NASA team mulled over this information. One of them) Tj
T* (   looked up area 48. It was New Zealand.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   New Zealand?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The NASA team were left scratching their heads. This attack was) Tj
T* (   getting stranger by the minute. Just when it seemed that the SPAN team) Tj
T* (   members were travelling down the right path toward an answer at the) Tj
T* (   centre of the maze of clues, they turned a corner and found themselves) Tj
T* (   hopelessly lost again. Then someone pointed out that New Zealand's) Tj

T* (   the system security was lax enough for it to be successful. The worm) Tj
T* (   then compared that list to the list of users on its current host. When) Tj
T* (   it found a match--an account name common to both lists--the worm added) Tj
T* (   that name to the masterlist it carried around inside it, making a note) Tj
T* (   to try that account when breaking into a new system in future.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was a clever method of attack, for the worm's creator knew that) Tj
T* (   certain accounts with the highest privileges were likely to have) Tj
T* (   standard names, common across different machines. Accounts with names) Tj
T* (   such as `SYSTEM', `DECNET' and `FIELD' with standard passwords such as) Tj
T* (   `SYSTEM' and `DECNET' were often built into a computer before it was) Tj
T* (   shipped from the manufacturer. If the receiving computer manager) Tj
T* (   didn't change the pre-programmed account and password, then his) Tj
T* (   computer would have a large security hole waiting to be exploited.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The worm's creator could guess some of the names of these) Tj
T* (   manufacturer's accounts, but not all of them. By endowing the worm) Tj
T* (   with an ability to learn, he gave it far more power. As the worm) Tj
T* (   spread, it became more and more intelligent. As it reproduced, its) Tj
T* (   offspring evolved into ever more advanced creatures, increasingly) Tj
T* (   successful at breaking into new systems.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When McMahon performed an autopsy on one of the worm's progeny, he was) Tj
T* (   impressed with what he found. Slicing the worm open and inspecting its) Tj
T* (   entrails, he discovered an extensive collection of generic privileged) Tj
T* (   accounts across the SPAN network. In fact, the worm wasn't only picking) Tj
T* (   up the standard VMS privileged accounts; it had learned accounts common) Tj
T* (   to NASA but not necessarily to other VMS computers. For example, a lot) Tj
T* (   of NASA sites which ran a type of TCP/IP mailer that needed either a) Tj
T* (   POSTMASTER or a MAILER account. John saw those names turn up inside the) Tj
T* (   worm's progeny.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Even if it only managed to break into an unprivileged account, the) Tj
T* (   worm would use the account as an incubator. The worm replicated and) Tj
T* (   then attacked other computers in the network. As McMahon and the rest) Tj
T* (   of the SPAN team continued to pick apart the rest of the worm's code) Tj
T* (   to figure out exactly what the creature would do if it got into a) Tj
T* (   fully privileged account, they found more evidence of the dark sense) Tj
T* (   of humour harboured by the hacker behind the worm. Part of the worm, a) Tj
T* (   subroutine, was named `find fucked'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The SPAN team tried to give NASA managers calling in as much) Tj
T* (   information as they could about the worm. It was the best way to help) Tj
T* (   computer managers, isolated in their offices around the country, to) Tj
T* (   regain a sense of control over the crisis.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Like all the SPAN team, McMahon tried to calm the callers down and) Tj
T* (   walk them through a set a questions designed to determine the extent) Tj
T* (   of the worm's control over their systems. First, he asked them what) Tj
T* (   symptoms their systems were showing. In a crisis situation, when) Tj
T* (   you're holding a hammer, everything looks like a nail. McMahon wanted) Tj
T* (   to make sure that the problems on the system were in fact caused by) Tj
T* (   the worm and not something else entirely.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   If the only problem seemed to be mysterious comments flashing across) Tj
T* (   the screen, McMahon concluded that the worm was probably harassing the) Tj
T* (   staff on that computer from a neighbouring system which it had) Tj

T* (   VAX/VMS machines have a feature called Phone, which is useful for) Tj
T* (   on-line communications. For example, a NASA scientist could `ring up') Tj
T* (   one of his colleagues on a different computer and have a friendly chat) Tj
T* (   on-line. The chat session is live, but it is conducted by typing on) Tj
T* (   the computer screen, not `voice'. The VMS Phone facility enabled the) Tj
T* (   worm to send messages to users. It would simply call them using the) Tj
T* (   phone protocol. But instead of starting a chat session, it sent them) Tj
T* (   statements from what was later determined to be the aptly named) Tj
T* (   Fortune Cookie file--a collection of 60 or so pre-programmed comments.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In some cases, where the worm was really bugging staff, McMahon told) Tj

T* (   feature off. A few managers complained and McMahon gave them the) Tj
T* (   obvious ultimatum: choose Phone or peace. Most chose peace.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When McMahon finished his preliminary analysis, he had good news and) Tj
T* (   bad news. The good news was that, contrary to what the worm was) Tj
T* (   telling computer users all over NASA, it was not actually deleting) Tj
T* (   their files. It was just pretending to delete their data. One big) Tj
T* (   practical joke. To the creator of the worm anyway. To the NASA) Tj
T* (   scientists, just a headache and heartache. And occasionally a heart) Tj
T* (   attack.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The bad news was that, when the worm got control over a privileged) Tj
T* (   account, it would help someone--presumably its creator--perpetrate an) Tj
T* (   even more serious break-in at NASA. The worm sought out the FIELD) Tj
T* (   account created by the manufacturer and, if it had been turned off,) Tj
T* (   tried to reactivate the account and install the password FIELD. The) Tj
T* (   worm was also programmed to change the password for the standard) Tj
T* (   account named DECNET to a random string of at least twelve characters.) Tj
T* (   In short, the worm tried to pry open a backdoor to the system.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The worm sent information about accounts it had successfully broken) Tj
T* (   into back to a type of electronic mailbox--an account called GEMPAK on) Tj
T* (   SPAN node 6.59. Presumably, the hacker who created the worm would) Tj
T* (   check the worm's mailbox for information which he could use to break) Tj
T* (   into the NASA account at a later date. Not surprisingly, the mailboxes) Tj
T* (   had been surreptitiously `borrowed' by the hacker, much to the) Tj
T* (   surprise of the legitimate owners.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A computer hacker created a whole new set of problems. Although the) Tj
T* (   worm was able to break into new accounts with greater speed and reach) Tj
T* (   than a single hacker, it was more predictable. Once the SPAN and DOE) Tj
T* (   teams picked the worm apart, they would know exactly what it could be) Tj
T* (   expected to do. However, a hacker was utterly unpredictable.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   McMahon realised that killing off the worm was not going to solve the) Tj
T* (   problem. All the system managers across the NASA and DOE networks) Tj
T* (   would have to change all the passwords of the accounts used by the) Tj
T* (   worm. They would also have to check every system the worm had invaded) Tj
T* (   to see if it had built a backdoor for the hacker. The system admin had) Tj
T* (   to shut and lock all the backdoors, no small feat.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   What really scared the SPAN team about the worm, however, was that it) Tj
T* (   was rampaging through NASA simply by using the simplest of attack) Tj
T* (   strategies: username equals password. It was getting complete control) Tj

T* (   as black comedy.) Tj

T* (   The NASA site had a password of SYSTEM for their fully privileged) Tj

T* (   computer system manager with a fully privileged account.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Was the hacker behind the worm malevolent? Probably not. If its) Tj
T* (   creator had wanted to, he could have programmed the WANK worm to) Tj
T* (   obliterate NASA's files. It could have razed everything in sight.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In fact, the worm was less infectious than its author appeared to) Tj
T* (   desire. The WANK worm had been instructed to perform) Tj
T* (   several tasks which it didn't execute. Important parts of the worm) Tj
T* (   simply didn't work. McMahon believed this failure to be accidental.) Tj
T* (   For example, his analysis showed the worm was programmed to break into) Tj
T* (   accounts by trying no password, if the account holder had left the) Tj
T* (   password blank. When he disassembled the worm, however, he found that) Tj
T* (   part of the program didn't work properly.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Nonetheless, the fragmented and partly dysfunctional WANK worm was) Tj
T* (   causing a major crisis inside several US government agencies. The) Tj

T* (   WANK worm was just a dry run for something more serious down the) Tj
T* (   track? It was scary to contemplate.) Tj

T* (   Even though the WANK worm did not seem to be intentionally evil, the) Tj

T* (   basic question was, `Where is "here"?' And of course if the SPAN) Tj

T* (   been released before it was finished. Its author or authors seemed to) Tj
T* (   have a good collection of interesting ideas about how to solve) Tj
T* (   problems, but they were never properly completed. The worm included a) Tj
T* (   routine for modifying its attack strategy, but the thing was never) Tj
T* (   fully developed. The worm's code didn't have enough error handling in) Tj

T* (   On the other hand, maybe the creator had done this deliberately. Maybe) Tj
T* (   he had wanted to show the world just how many computers the worm could) Tj
T* (   successfully penetrate. The worm's mail-back program would do this.) Tj
T* (   However, including the address of each infected site would have made) Tj
T* (   the admins' jobs easier. They could simply have used the GEMPAK) Tj
T* (   collection as a hitlist of infected sites which needed to be) Tj
T* (   de-wormed. The possible theories were endless.) Tj

T* (   maintained his view that it was the work of a single hacker.) Tj

T* (   not already running on that computer. It did this by checking for its) Tj

T* (   Advisory Notice) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A worm is attacking NASA's SPAN network via VAX/VMS systems connected) Tj
T* (   to DECnet. It is unclear if the spread of the worm has been checked.) Tj
T* (   It may spread to other systems such as DOE's HEPNET within a few days.) Tj
T* (   VMS system managers should prepare now.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The worm targets VMS machines, and can only be propagated via DECnet.) Tj
T* (   The worm exploits two features of DECnet/VMS in order to propagate) Tj
T* (   itself. The first is the default DECnet account, which is a facility) Tj
T* (   for users who don't have a specific login ID for a machine to have) Tj
T* (   some degree of anonymous access. It uses the default DECnet account to) Tj
T* (   copy itself to a machine, and then uses the `TASK 0' feature of DECnet) Tj
T* (   to invoke the remote copy. It has several other features including a) Tj
T* (   brute force attack.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Once the worm has successfully penetrated your system it will infect) Tj
T* (   .COM files and create new security vulnerabilities. It then seems to) Tj
T* (   broadcast these vulnerabilities to the outside world. It may also) Tj
T* (   damage files as well, either unintentionally or otherwise.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   An analysis of the worm appears below and is provided by R. Kevin) Tj
T* (   Oberman of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Included with the) Tj
T* (   analysis is a DCL program that will block the current version of the) Tj
T* (   worm. At least two versions of this worm exist and more may be) Tj
T* (   created. This program should give you enough time to close up obvious) Tj
T* (   security holes. A more thorough DCL program is being written.) Tj

T* (   destroying the thing themselves.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Ron Tencati procured a copy of the French manager's worm-killing) Tj
T* (   program and gave it to McMahon, who set up a sort of mini-laboratory) Tj
T* (   experiment. He cut the worm into pieces and extracted the relevant) Tj
T* (   bits. This allowed him to test the French worm-killing program with) Tj
T* (   little risk of the worm escaping and doing damage. The French program) Tj
T* (   worked wonderfully. Out it went. The second version of the worm was so) Tj
T* (   much more virulent, getting it out of SPAN was going to take) Tj
T* (   considerably longer than the first time around. Finally, almost two) Tj
T* (   weeks after the second onslaught, the WANK worm had been eradicated) Tj
T* (   from SPAN.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   By McMahon's estimate, the WANK worm had incurred up to half a million) Tj
T* (   dollars in costs. Most of these were through people wasting time and) Tj
T* (   resources chasing the worm instead of doing their normal jobs. The) Tj
T* (   worm was, in his view, a crime of theft. `People's time and resources) Tj
T* (   had been wasted,' he said. `The theft was not the result of the) Tj
T* (   accident. This was someone who deliberately went out to make a mess.) Tj

T* (   `In general, I support prosecuting people who think breaking into) Tj

T* (   That is not true. You end up wasting people's time. People are dragged) Tj

T* (   the price.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   McMahon never found out who created the WANK worm. Nor did he ever) Tj

T* (   motives were never clear and, if it had been politically inspired,) Tj
T* (   no-one took credit.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The WANK worm left a number of unanswered questions in its wake, a) Tj
T* (   number of loose ends which still puzzle John McMahon. Was the hacker) Tj
T* (   behind the worm really protesting against NASA's launch of the) Tj
T* (   plutonium-powered Galileo space probe? Did the use of the word) Tj
T* (   `WANK'--a most un-American word--mean the hacker wasn't American? Why) Tj
T* (   had the creator recreated the worm and released it a second time? Why) Tj
T* (   had no-one, no political or other group, claimed responsibility for) Tj
T* (   the WANK worm?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   One of the many details which remained an enigma was contained in the) Tj
T* (   version of the worm used in the second attack. The worm's creator had) Tj
T* (   replaced the original process name, NETW_, with a new one, presumably) Tj
T* (   to thwart the anti-WANK program. McMahon figured the original process) Tj
T* (   name stood for `netwank'--a reasonable guess at the hacker's intended) Tj
T* (   meaning. The new process name, however, left everyone on the SPAN team) Tj
T* (   scratching their heads: it didn't seem to stand for anything. The) Tj
T* (   letters formed an unlikely set of initials for someone's name. No-one) Tj
T* (   recognised it as an acronym for a saying or an organisation. And it) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In the best tradition of cloak-and-dagger government agencies, the FBI) Tj

T* (   embassies, attachÈs, formal communiques and interminable delays in) Tj

T* (   involved a few phone calls and some fast answers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Ron Tencati had a colleague named Chris on the SPAN network in France,) Tj

T* (   more than just science computer networks. He had certain contacts in) Tj
T* (   the French government and seemed to be involved in their computer) Tj

T* (   after the worm's release.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Tencati had established the French connection from some computer logs) Tj
T* (   showing NASA under attack very early on Monday, 16 October. The logs) Tj
T* (   were important because they were relatively clear. As the worm had) Tj
T* (   procreated during that day, it had forced computers all over the) Tj
T* (   network to attack each other in ever greater numbers. By 11 a.m. it) Tj
T* (   was almost impossible to tell where any one attack began and the other) Tj
T* (   ended.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Some time after the first attack, DST sent word that certain agents) Tj
T* (   were going to be in Washington DC regarding other matters. They wanted) Tj
T* (   a meeting with the FBI. A representative from the NASA Inspector) Tj
T* (   General's Office would attend the meeting, as would someone from NASA) Tj

T* (   Tencati was sure he could show the WANK worm attack on NASA originated) Tj
T* (   in France. But he also knew he had to document everything, to have) Tj
T* (   exact answers to every question and counter-argument put forward by) Tj
T* (   the French secret service agents at the FBI meeting. When he developed) Tj
T* (   a timeline of attacks, he found that the GEMPAK machine showed X.25) Tj
T* (   network connection, via another system, from a French computer around) Tj
T* (   the same time as the WANK worm attack. He followed the scent and) Tj
T* (   contacted the manager of that system. Would he help Tencati? Mais oui.) Tj
T* (   The machine is at your disposal, Monsieur Tencati.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Tencati had never used an X.25 network before; it had a unique set of) Tj
T* (   commands unlike any other type of computer communications network. He) Tj
T* (   wanted to retrace the steps of the worm, but he needed help. So he) Tj
T* (   called his friend Bob Lyons at DEC to walk him through the process.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   What Tencati found startled him. There were traces of the worm on the) Tj
T* (   machine all right, the familiar pattern of login failures as the worm) Tj
T* (   attempted to break into different accounts. But these remnants of the) Tj
T* (   WANK worm were not dated 16 October or any time immediately around) Tj
T* (   then. The logs showed worm-related activity up to two weeks before the) Tj
T* (   attack on NASA. This computer was not just a pass-through machine the) Tj
T* (   worm had used to launch its first attack on NASA. This was the) Tj
T* (   development machine.) Tj

T* (   Ground zero.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Tencati went into the meeting with DST at the FBI offices prepared. He) Tj
T* (   knew the accusations the French were going to put forward. When he) Tj
T* (   presented the results of his sleuthwork, the French secret service) Tj
T* (   couldn't refute it, but they dropped their own bombshell. Yes they) Tj
T* (   told him, you might be able to point to a French system as ground zero) Tj
T* (   for the attack, but our investigations reveal incoming X.25) Tj

T* (   Affordable home computers, such as the Apple IIe and the Commodore 64,) Tj
T* (   made their way into ordinary suburban families. While these computers) Tj
T* (   were not widespread, they were at least in a price range which made) Tj
T* (   them attainable by dedicated computer enthusiasts.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In 1988, the year before the WANK worm attack on NASA, Australia was) Tj
T* (   on an upswing. The country was celebrating its bicentennial. The) Tj
T* (   economy was booming. Trade barriers and old regulatory structures were) Tj
T* (   coming down. Crocodile Dundee had already burst on the world movie) Tj
T* (   scene and was making Australians the flavour of the month in cities) Tj
T* (   like LA and New York. The mood was optimistic. People had a sense they) Tj
T* (   were going places. Australia, a peaceful country of seventeen or so) Tj
T* (   million people, poised on the edge of Asia but with the order of a) Tj
T* (   Western European democracy, was on its way up. Perhaps for the first) Tj

T* (   Exploration and experimentation require confidence and, in 1988,) Tj
T* (   confidence was something Australia had finally attained.) Tj

T* (   Yet this new-found confidence and optimism did not subdue Australia's) Tj
T* (   tradition of cynicism toward large institutions. The two coexisted,) Tj
T* (   suspended in a strange paradox. Australian humour, deeply rooted in a) Tj
T* (   scepticism of all things serious and sacred, continued to poke fun at) Tj
T* (   upright institutions with a depth of irreverence surprising to many) Tj
T* (   foreigners. This cynicism of large, respected institutions coursed) Tj
T* (   through the newly formed Australian computer underground without) Tj
T* (   dampening its excitement or optimism for the brave new world of) Tj
T* (   computers in the least.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In 1988, the Australian computer underground thrived like a vibrant) Tj
T* (   Asian street bazaar. In that year it was still a realm of place not) Tj
T* (   space. Customers visited their regular stalls, haggled over goods with) Tj
T* (   vendors, bumped into friends and waved across crowded paths to) Tj
T* (   acquaintances. The market was as much a place to socialise as it was) Tj
T* (   to shop. People ducked into tiny coffee houses or corner bars for) Tj
T* (   intimate chats. The latest imported goods, laid out on tables like) Tj
T* (   reams of bright Chinese silks, served as conversation starters. And,) Tj
T* (   like every street market, many of the best items were tucked away,) Tj
T* (   hidden in anticipation of the appearance of that one customer or) Tj
T* (   friend most favoured by the trader. The currency of the underground) Tj
T* (   was not money; it was information. People didn't share and exchange) Tj
T* (   information to accumulate monetary wealth; they did it to win) Tj
T* (   respect--and to buy a thrill.) Tj

T* (   coloured ribbon across the surface of a corkboard to divide it into) Tj

T* (   bazaar full of vitality and the sharing of ideas. For the most part,) Tj
T* (   people trusted their peers within the community and the BBS operators,) Tj
T* (   who were often revered as demigods. It was a happy place. And, in) Tj
T* (   general, it was a safe place, which is perhaps one reason why its) Tj

T* (   Australia's intellectual centre created a breeding ground for the many) Tj
T* (   young people who built their systems with little more than curiosity) Tj

T* (   then vanished again.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Some of them operated only during certain hours, say between 10 p.m.) Tj
T* (   and 8 a.m. When the owner went to bed, he or she would plug the home) Tj

T* (   24 hours a day, but the busiest times were always at night.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Of course it wasn't just intellectual stimulation some users were) Tj
T* (   after. Visitors often sought identity as much as ideas. On an) Tj
T* (   electronic bulletin board, you could create a personality, mould it) Tj
T* (   into shape and make it your own. Age and appearance did not matter.) Tj
T* (   Technical aptitude did. Any spotty, gawky teenage boy could instantly) Tj
T* (   transform himself into a suave, graceful BBS character. The) Tj
T* (   transformation began with the choice of name. In real life, you might) Tj

T* (   mother to honour a long-dead great uncle. But on a BBS, well, you) Tj

T* (   Generally, once a user chose a handle, as the on-line names are known,) Tj
T* (   he stuck with it. All his electronic mail came to an account with that) Tj
T* (   name on it. Postings to bulletin boards were signed with it. Others) Tj
T* (   dwelling in the system world knew him by that name and no other. A) Tj
T* (   handle evolved into a name laden with innate meaning, though the) Tj
T* (   personality reflected in it might well have been an alter ego. And so) Tj
T* (   it was that characters like The Wizard, Conan and Iceman came to pass) Tj
T* (   their time on BBSes like the Crystal Palace, Megaworks, The Real) Tj
T* (   Connection and Electric Dreams.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   What such visitors valued about the BBS varied greatly. Some wanted to) Tj
T* (   participate in its social life. They wanted to meet people like) Tj
T* (   themselves--bright but geeky or misanthropic people who shared an) Tj
T* (   interest in the finer technical points of computers. Many lived as) Tj
T* (   outcasts in real life, never quite making it into the `normal' groups) Tj
T* (   of friends at school or uni. Though some had started their first jobs,) Tj
T* (   they hadn't managed to shake the daggy awkwardness which pursued them) Tj
T* (   throughout their teen years. On the surface, they were just not the) Tj
T* (   sort of people one asked out to the pub for a cold one after the) Tj
T* (   footy.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But that was all right. In general, they weren't much interested in) Tj
T* (   footy anyway.) Tj

T* (   Each BBS had its own style. Some were completely legitimate, with) Tj
T* (   their wares--all legal goods--laid out in the open. Others, like The) Tj
T* (   Real Connection, had once housed Australia's earliest hackers but had) Tj
T* (   gone straight. They closed up the hacking parts of the board before) Tj
T* (   the first Commonwealth government hacking laws were enacted in June) Tj
T* (   1989. Perhaps ten or twelve of Melbourne's BBSes at the time had the) Tj
T* (   secret, smoky flavour of the computer underground. A handful of these) Tj
T* (   were invitation-only boards, places like Greyhawk and The Realm. You) Tj
T* (   couldn't simply ring up the board, create a new account and login. You) Tj

T* (   himself Craig Bowen ran both systems from his bedroom.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Also known as Thunderbird1, Bowen started up Pacific Island in 1987) Tj
T* (   because he wanted a hub for hackers. The fledgling hacking community) Tj
T* (   was dispersed after AHUBBS, possibly Melbourne's earliest hacking) Tj
T* (   board, faded away. Bowen decided to create a home for it, a sort of) Tj
T* (   dark, womb-like cafe bar amid the bustle of the BBS bazaar where) Tj
T* (   Melbourne's hackers could gather and share information.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   His bedroom was a simple, boyish place. Built-in cupboards, a bed, a) Tj
T* (   wallpaper design of vintage cars running across one side of the room.) Tj
T* (   A window overlooking the neighbours' leafy suburban yard. A collection) Tj
T* (   of PC magazines with titles like Nibble and Byte. A few volumes on) Tj
T* (   computer programming. VAX/VMS manuals. Not many books, but a handful) Tj
T* (   of science fiction works by Arthur C. Clarke. The Hitchhiker's Guide) Tj
T* (   to the Galaxy. A Chinese-language dictionary used during his high) Tj
T* (   school Mandarin classes, and after, as he continued to study the) Tj
T* (   language on his own while he held down his first job.) Tj

T* (   The Apple IIe, modem and telephone line rested on the drop-down) Tj
T* (   drawing table and fold-up card table at the foot of his bed. Bowen put) Tj
T* (   his TV next to the computer so he could sit in bed, watch TV and use) Tj
T* (   Pacific Island all at the same time. Later, when he started Zen, it) Tj
T* (   sat next to Pacific Island. It was the perfect set-up.) Tj

T* (   Pacific Island was hardly fancy by today's standards of Unix Internet) Tj
T* (   machines, but in 1987 it was an impressive computer. PI, pronounced) Tj
T* (   `pie' by the local users, had a 20 megabyte hard drive--gargantuan for) Tj
T* (   a personal computer at the time. Bowen spent about $5000 setting up PI) Tj
T* (   alone. He loved both systems and spent many hours each week nurturing) Tj
T* (   them.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   There was no charge for computer accounts on PI or ZEN, like most) Tj
T* (   BBSes. This gentle-faced youth, a half-boy, half-man who would) Tj
T* (   eventually play host on his humble BBS to many of Australia's) Tj
T* (   cleverest computer and telephone hackers, could afford to pay for his) Tj
T* (   computers for two reasons: he lived at home with his mum and dad, and) Tj
T* (   he had a full-time job at Telecom--then the only domestic telephone) Tj
T* (   carrier in Australia.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   PI had about 800 computer users, up to 200 of whom were `core' users) Tj
T* (   accessing the system regularly. PI had its own dedicated phone line,) Tj
T* (   separate from the house phone so Bowen's parents wouldn't get upset the) Tj
T* (   line was always tied up. Later, he put in four additional phone lines) Tj
T* (   for Zen, which had about 2000 users. Using his Telecom training, he) Tj
T* (   installed a number of non-standard, but legal, features to his) Tj
T* (   house. Junction boxes, master switches. Bowen's house was a) Tj
T* (   telecommunications hot-rod.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Bowen had decided early on that if he wanted to keep his job, he had) Tj
T* (   better not do anything illegal when it came to Telecom. However, the) Tj
T* (   Australian national telecommunications carrier was a handy source of) Tj
T* (   technical information. For example, he had an account on a Telecom) Tj
T* (   computer system--for work--from which he could learn about Telecom's) Tj
T* (   exchanges. But he never used that account for hacking. Most) Tj
T* (   respectable hackers followed a similar philosophy. Some had legitimate) Tj
T* (   university computer accounts for their courses, but they kept those) Tj
T* (   accounts clean. A basic rule of the underground, in the words of one) Tj
T* (   hacker, was `Don't foul your own nest'.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   PI contained a public section and a private one. The public area was) Tj
T* (   like an old-time pub. Anyone could wander in, plop down at the bar and) Tj
T* (   start up a conversation with a group of locals. Just ring up the) Tj
T* (   system with your modem and type in your details--real name, your) Tj
T* (   chosen handle, phone number and other basic information.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Many BBS users gave false information in order to hide their true) Tj
T* (   identities, and many operators didn't really care. Bowen, however,) Tj
T* (   did. Running a hacker's board carried some risk, even before the) Tj
T* (   federal computer crime laws came into force. Pirated software was) Tj
T* (   illegal. Storing data copied from hacking adventures in foreign) Tj
T* (   computers might also be considered illegal. In an effort to exclude) Tj
T* (   police and media spies, Bowen tried to verify the personal details of) Tj
T* (   every user on PI by ringing them at home or work. Often he was) Tj
T* (   successful. Sometimes he wasn't.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The public section of PI housed discussion groups on the major PC) Tj
T* (   brands--IBM, Commodore, Amiga, Apple and Atari--next to the popular) Tj
T* (   Lonely Hearts group. Lonely Hearts had about twenty regulars, most of) Tj
T* (   whom agonised under the weight of pubescent hormonal changes. A boy) Tj
T* (   pining for the affections of the girl who dumped him or, worse, didn't) Tj

T* (   were completely anonymous, readers didn't even know the authors') Tj
T* (   handles, and that anonymous setting allowed heart-felt messages and) Tj
T* (   genuine responses.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Zen was PI's sophisticated younger sister. Within two years of PI) Tj
T* (   making its debut, Bowen opened up Zen, one of the first Australian) Tj
T* (   BBSes with more than one telephone line. The main reason he set up Zen) Tj
T* (   was to stop his computer users from bothering him all the time. When) Tj
T* (   someone logged into PI, one of the first things he or she did was) Tj
T* (   request an on-line chat with the system operator. PI's Apple IIe was) Tj
T* (   such a basic machine by today's standards, Bowen couldn't multi-task) Tj
T* (   on it. He could not do anything with the machine, such as check his) Tj
T* (   own mail, while a visitor was logged into PI.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Zen was a watershed in the Australian BBS community. Zen multi-tasked.) Tj
T* (   Up to four people could ring up and login to the machine at any one) Tj
T* (   time, and Bowen could do his own thing while his users were on-line.) Tj
T* (   Better still, his users could talk request each other instead of) Tj
T* (   hassling him all the time. Having users on a multi-tasking machine) Tj
T* (   with multiple phone lines was like having a gaggle of children. For) Tj
T* (   the most part, they amused each other.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mainstream and respectful of authority on the surface, Bowen possessed) Tj
T* (   the same streak of anti-establishment views harboured by many in the) Tj
T* (   underground. His choice of name for Zen underlined this. Zen came from) Tj
T* (   the futuristic British TV science fiction series `Blake 7', in which a) Tj
T* (   bunch of underfunded rebels attempted to overthrow an evil) Tj
T* (   totalitarian government. Zen was the computer on the rebels' ship. The) Tj
T* (   rebels banded together after meeting on a prison ship; they were all) Tj
T* (   being transported to a penal settlement on another planet. It was a) Tj
T* (   story people in the Australian underground could relate to. One of the) Tj
T* (   lead characters, a sort of heroic anti-hero, had been sentenced to) Tj
T* (   prison for computer hacking. His big mistake, he told fellow rebels,) Tj
T* (   was that he had relied on other people. He trusted them. He should) Tj

T* (   merely passed through, occasionally stopping in to check out the) Tj

T* (   close-knit PI family. Nom helped Bowen set up PI. Like many early) Tj
T* (   members of the underground, they met through AUSOM, an Apple users') Tj
T* (   society in Melbourne. Bowen wanted to run ASCII Express, a program) Tj
T* (   which allowed people to transfer files between their own computers and) Tj
T* (   PI. But, as usual, he and everyone he knew only had a pirated copy of) Tj
T* (   the program. No manuals. So Nom and Bowen spent one weekend picking) Tj

T* (   Northcote's Valhalla Theatre \(now the Westgarth\). Its grand but) Tj
T* (   slightly tatty vintage atmosphere lent itself to this alternative) Tj
T* (   culture flourishing in late-night revelries. Leaping up on stage) Tj
T* (   mid-film, the PI groupies sent up the actors in key scenes. It was a) Tj
T* (   fun and, as importantly, a cheap evening. The Valhalla staff admitted) Tj
T* (   regulars who were dressed in appropriate costume for free. The only) Tj
T* (   thing the groupies had to pay for was drinks at the intermission.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Occasionally, Bowen arranged gatherings of other young PI and Zen) Tj
T* (   users. Usually, the group met in downtown Melbourne, sometimes at the) Tj
T* (   City Square. The group was mostly boys, but sometimes a few girls) Tj
T* (   would show up. Bowen's sister, who used the handle Syn, hung around a) Tj
T* (   bit. She went out with a few hackers from the BBS scene. And she) Tj
T* (   wasn't the only one. It was a tight group which interchanged) Tj
T* (   boyfriends and girlfriends with considerable regularity. The group) Tj
T* (   hung out in the City Square after watching a movie, usually a horror) Tj
T* (   film. Nightmare 2. House 3. Titles tended to be a noun followed by a) Tj
T* (   numeral. Once, for a bit of lively variation, they went bowling and) Tj

T* (   entertainment, it was down to McDonald's for a cheap burger. They) Tj

T* (   to have found out Bowen's details. Bowen invited him in and showed him) Tj
T* (   the system. They became friends. But after that incident, Bowen) Tj
T* (   decided to tighten security around his personal details even more. He) Tj
T* (   began, in his own words, `moving toward full anonymity'. He invented) Tj
T* (   the name Craig Bowen, and everyone in the underground came to know him) Tj
T* (   by that name or his handle, Thunderbird1. He even opened a false bank) Tj
T* (   account in the name of Bowen for the periodic voluntary donations) Tj

T* (   they would brand you a blabbermouth. A perfect bargaining chip was an) Tj
T* (   old password for Melbourne University's dial-out.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The university's dial-out was a valuable thing. A hacker could ring up) Tj
T* (   the university's computer, login as `modem' and the machine would drop) Tj
T* (   him into a modem which let him dial out again. He could then dial) Tj
T* (   anywhere in the world, and the university would foot the phone bill.) Tj
T* (   In the late 1980s, before the days of cheap, accessible Internet) Tj
T* (   connections, the university dial-out meant a hacker could access) Tj
T* (   anything from an underground BBS in Germany to a US military system in) Tj
T* (   Panama. The password put the world at his fingertips.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A hacker aspiring to move into PI's Inner Sanctum wouldn't give out) Tj
T* (   the current dial-out password in the public discussion areas. Most) Tj
T* (   likely, if he was low in the pecking order, he wouldn't have such) Tj
T* (   precious information. Even if he had managed to stumble across the) Tj
T* (   current password somehow, it was risky giving it out publicly. Every) Tj
T* (   wanna-be and his dog would start messing around with the university's) Tj
T* (   modem account. The system administrator would wise up and change the) Tj
T* (   password and the hacker would quickly lose his own access to the) Tj
T* (   university account. Worse, he would lose access for other hackers--the) Tj
T* (   kind of hackers who ran H.A.C.K., Elite and the Inner Sanctum. They) Tj
T* (   would be really cross. Hackers hate it when passwords on accounts they) Tj
T* (   consider their own are changed without warning. Even if the password) Tj
T* (   wasn't changed, the aspiring hacker would look like a guy who couldn't) Tj
T* (   keep a good secret.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Posting an old password, however, was quite a different matter. The) Tj
T* (   information was next to useless, so the hacker wouldn't be giving much) Tj
T* (   away. But just showing he had access to that sort of information) Tj
T* (   suggested he was somehow in the know. Other hackers might think he had) Tj
T* (   had the password when it was still valid. More importantly, by showing) Tj
T* (   off a known, expired password, the hacker hinted that he might just) Tj
T* (   have the current password. Voila! Instant respect.) Tj

T* (   Positioning oneself to win an invite into the Inner Sanctum was a game) Tj
T* (   of strategy; titillate but never go all the way. After a while,) Tj

T* (   Back in early 1988, Mendax was just beginning to explore the world of) Tj
T* (   hacking. He had managed to break through the barrier from public to) Tj
T* (   private section of PI, but it wasn't enough. To be recognised as) Tj
T* (   up-and-coming talent by the aristocracy of hackers such as The Force) Tj
T* (   and The Wizard, a hacker had to spend time inside the Minerva system.) Tj
T* (   Mendax set to work on breaking) Tj
T* (   into it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Minerva was special for a number of reasons. Although it was in) Tj
T* (   Sydney, the phone number to its entry computer, called an X.25 pad,) Tj
T* (   was a free call. At the time Mendax lived in Emerald, a country town) Tj
T* (   on the outskirts of Melbourne. A call to most Melbourne numbers) Tj
T* (   incurred a long-distance charge, thus ruling out options such as the) Tj
T* (   Melbourne University dial-out for breaking into international computer) Tj
T* (   systems.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Emerald was hardly Emerald City. For a clever sixteen-year-old boy,) Tj
T* (   the place was dead boring. Mendax lived there with his mother; Emerald) Tj
T* (   was merely a stopping point, one of dozens, as his mother shuttled her) Tj
T* (   child around the continent trying to escape from a psychopathic former) Tj
T* (   de facto. The house was an emergency refuge for families on the run.) Tj
T* (   It was safe and so, for a time, Mendax and his exhausted family) Tj
T* (   stopped to rest before tearing off again in search of a new place to) Tj
T* (   hide.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Sometimes Mendax went to school. Often he didn't. The school system) Tj
T* (   didn't hold much interest for him. It didn't feed his mind the way) Tj
T* (   Minerva would. They Sydney computer system was a far more interesting) Tj
T* (   place to muck around in than the rural high school.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Minerva was a Prime computer, and Primes were in. Force, one of the) Tj
T* (   more respected hackers in 1987-88 in the Australian computer) Tj
T* (   underground, specialised in Primos, the special operating system used) Tj
T* (   on Prime computers. He wrote his own programs--potent hacking tools) Tj
T* (   which provided current usernames and passwords--and made the systems) Tj
T* (   fashionable in the computer underground.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Prime computers were big and expensive and no hacker could afford one,) Tj
T* (   so being able to access the speed and computational grunt of a system) Tj
T* (   like Minerva was valuable for running a hacker's own programs. For) Tj
T* (   example, a network scanner, a program which gathered the addresses of) Tj
T* (   computers on the X.25 network which would be targets for future) Tj
T* (   hacking adventures, ate up computing resources. But a huge machine) Tj
T* (   like Minerva could handle that sort of program with ease. Minerva also) Tj
T* (   allowed users to connect to other computer systems on the X.25 network) Tj
T* (   around the world. Better still, Minerva had a BASIC interpreter on it.) Tj
T* (   This allowed people to write programs in the BASIC programming) Tj
T* (   language--by far the most popular language at the time--and make them) Tj
T* (   run on Minerva. You didn't have to be a Primos fanatic, like Force, to) Tj
T* (   write and execute a program on the OTC computer. Minerva suited Mendax) Tj
T* (   very well.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The OTC system had other benefits. Most major Australian corporations) Tj
T* (   had accounts on the system. Breaking into an account requires a) Tj
T* (   username and password; find the username and you have solved half the) Tj
T* (   equation. Minerva account names were easy picking. Each one was) Tj
T* (   composed of three letters followed by three numbers, a system which) Tj
T* (   could have been difficult to crack except for the choice of those) Tj
T* (   letters and numbers. The first three letters were almost always) Tj
T* (   obvious acronyms for the company. For example, the ANZ Bank had) Tj

T* (   accounts named ANZ001, ANZ002 and ANZ002. The numbers followed the) Tj
T* (   same pattern for most companies. BHP001. CRA001. NAB001. Even OTC007.) Tj
T* (   Anyone with the IQ of a desk lamp could guess at least a few account) Tj
T* (   names on Minerva. Passwords were a bit tougher to come by, but Mendax) Tj
T* (   had some ideas for that. He was going to have a crack at social) Tj
T* (   engineering. Social engineering means smooth-talking someone in a) Tj
T* (   position of power into doing something for you. It always involved a) Tj
T* (   ruse of some sort.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax decided he would social engineer a password out of one of) Tj
T* (   Minerva's users. He had downloaded a partial list of Minerva users) Tj
T* (   another PI hacker had generously posted for those talented enough to) Tj
T* (   make use of it. This list was maybe two years old, and incomplete, but) Tj
T* (   it contained 30-odd pages of Minerva account usernames, company names,) Tj
T* (   addresses, contact names and telephone and fax numbers. Some of them) Tj
T* (   would probably still be valid.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax had a deep voice for his age; it would have been impossible to) Tj
T* (   even contemplate social engineering without it. Cracking adolescent) Tj
T* (   male voices were the kiss of death for would-be social engineers. But) Tj
T* (   even though he had the voice, he didn't have the office or the Sydney) Tj
T* (   phone number if the intended victim wanted a number to call back on.) Tj
T* (   He found a way to solve the Sydney phone number by poking around until) Tj
T* (   he dug up a number with Sydney's 02 area code which was permanently) Tj
T* (   engaged. One down, one to go.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Next problem: generate some realistic office background noise. He) Tj
T* (   could hardly call a company posing as an OTC official to cajole a) Tj
T* (   password when the only background noise was birds tweeting in the) Tj
T* (   fresh country air.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   No, he needed the same background buzz as a crowded office in downtown) Tj
T* (   Sydney. Mendex had a tape recorder, so he could pre-record the sound) Tj
T* (   of an office and play it as background when he called companies on the) Tj
T* (   Minerva list. The only hurdle was finding the appropriate office) Tj
T* (   noise. Not even the local post office would offer a believable noise) Tj
T* (   level. With none easily accessible, he decided to make his own audible) Tj
T* (   office clutter. It wouldn't be easy. With a single track on his) Tj
T* (   recording device, he couldn't dub in sounds on top of each other: he) Tj
T* (   had to make all the noises simultaneously.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   First, he turned on the TV news, down very low, so it just hummed in) Tj
T* (   the background. Then he set up a long document to print on his) Tj
T* (   Commodore MPS 801 printer. He removed the cover from the noisy dot) Tj
T* (   matrix machine, to create just the right volume of clackity-clack in) Tj
T* (   the background. Still, he needed something more. Operators' voices) Tj
T* (   mumbling across a crowded floor. He could mumble quietly to himself,) Tj
T* (   but he soon discovered his verbal skills had not developed to the) Tj
T* (   point of being able to stand in the middle of the room talking about) Tj
T* (   nothing to himself for a quarter of an hour. So he fished out his) Tj
T* (   volume of Shakespeare and started reading aloud. Loud enough to hear) Tj
T* (   voices, but not so loud that the intended victim would be able to pick) Tj
T* (   Macbeth. OTC operators had keyboards, so he began tapping randomly on) Tj
T* (   his. Occasionally, for a little variation, he walked up to the tape) Tj
T* (   recorder and asked a question--and then promptly answered it in) Tj
T* (   another voice. He stomped noisily away from the recorder again, across) Tj
T* (   the room, and then silently dove back to the keyboard for more) Tj
T* (   keyboard typing and mumblings of Macbeth.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was exhausting. He figured the tape had to run for at least fifteen) Tj

T* (   buzz suddenly went dead for three seconds at a time in the places) Tj
T* (   where he paused the tape to rest.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The tapes took a number of attempts. He would be halfway through,) Tj
T* (   racing through line after line of Shakespeare, rap-tap-tapping on his) Tj
T* (   keyboard and asking himself questions in authoritative voices when the) Tj
T* (   paper jammed in his printer. Damn. He had to start all over again.) Tj
T* (   Finally, after a tiring hour of auditory schizophrenia, he had the) Tj
T* (   perfect tape of office hubbub.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax pulled out his partial list of Minerva users and began working) Tj
T* (   through the 30-odd pages. It was discouraging.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `The number you have dialled is not connected. Please check the number) Tj

T* (   And another try.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Finally, success.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax reached one of the contact names for a company in Perth. Valid) Tj
T* (   number, valid company, valid contact name. He cleared his throat to) Tj
T* (   deepen his voice even further and began.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `This is John Keller, an operator from OTC Minerva in Sydney. One of) Tj
T* (   our D090 hard drives has crashed. We've pulled across the data on the) Tj
T* (   back-up tape and we believe we have all your correct information. But) Tj
T* (   some of it might have been corrupted in the accident and we would just) Tj
T* (   like to confirm your details. Also the back-up tape is two days old,) Tj
T* (   so we want to check your information is up to date so your service is) Tj
T* (   not interrupted. Let me just dig out your details ...' Mendax shuffled) Tj
T* (   some papers around on the table top.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Oh, dear. Yes. Let's check it,' the worried manager responded.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax started reading all the information on the Minerva list) Tj
T* (   obtained from Pacific Island, except for one thing. He changed the fax) Tj
T* (   number slightly. It worked. The manager jumped right in.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Oh, no. That's wrong. Our fax number is definitely wrong,' he said) Tj
T* (   and proceeded to give the correct number.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax tried to sound concerned. `Hmm,' he told the manager. `We may) Tj
T* (   have bigger problems than we anticipated. Hmm.' He gave another) Tj
T* (   pregnant pause. Working up the courage to ask the Big Question.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was hard to know who was sweating more, the fretting Perth manager,) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He had a quick look around, following the pattern of most hackers) Tj
T* (   breaking into a new machine. First thing to do was to check the) Tj
T* (   electronic mail of the `borrowed' account. Email often contains) Tj
T* (   valuable information. One company manager might send another) Tj
T* (   information about other account names, password changes or even phone) Tj
T* (   numbers to modems at the company itself. Then it was off to check the) Tj
T* (   directories available for anyone to read on the main system--another) Tj
T* (   good source of information. Final stop: Minerva's bulletin board of) Tj
T* (   news. This included postings from the system operators about planned) Tj
T* (   downtime or other service issues. He didn't stay long. The first visit) Tj
T* (   was usually mostly a bit of reconnaissance work.) Tj

T* (   time. And Minerva let Australian callers do this without incurring a) Tj
T* (   long-distance telephone charge.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In the early days of Minerva, the OTC operators didn't seem to care) Tj
T* (   much about the hackers, probably because it seemed impossible to get) Tj
T* (   rid of them. The OTC operators managed the OTC X.25 exchange, which) Tj
T* (   was like a telephone exchange for the X.25 data network. This exchange) Tj
T* (   was the data gateway for Minerva and other systems connected to that) Tj
T* (   data network.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Australia's early hackers had it easy, until Michael Rosenberg) Tj
T* (   arrived.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Rosenberg, known on-line simply as MichaelR, decided to clean up) Tj
T* (   Minerva. An engineering graduate from Queensland University, Michael) Tj
T* (   moved to Sydney when he joined OTC at age 21. He was about the same) Tj
T* (   age as the hackers he was chasing off his system. Rosenberg didn't) Tj
T* (   work as an OTC operator, he managed the software which ran on Minerva.) Tj
T* (   And he made life hell for people like Force. Closing up security) Tj
T* (   holes, quietly noting accounts used by hackers and then killing those) Tj
T* (   accounts, Rosenberg almost single-handedly stamped out much of the) Tj
T* (   hacker activity in OTC's Minerva.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Despite this, the hackers--`my hackers' as he termed the regulars--had) Tj
T* (   a grudging respect for Rosenberg. Unlike anyone else at OTC, he was) Tj
T* (   their technical equal and, in a world where technical prowess was the) Tj
T* (   currency, Rosenberg was a wealthy young man.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He wanted to catch the hackers, but he didn't want to see them go to) Tj
T* (   prison. They were an annoyance, and he just wanted them out of his) Tj
T* (   system. Any line trace, however, had to go through Telecom, which was) Tj
T* (   at that time a separate body from OTC. Telecom, Rosenberg was told,) Tj
T* (   was difficult about these things because of strict privacy laws. So,) Tj
T* (   for the most part, he was left to deal with the hackers on his own.) Tj
T* (   Rosenberg could not secure his system completely since OTC didn't) Tj
T* (   dictate passwords to their customers. Their customers were usually) Tj
T* (   more concerned about employees being able to remember passwords easily) Tj
T* (   than worrying about warding off wily hackers. The result: the) Tj
T* (   passwords on a number of Minerva accounts were easy pickings.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The hackers and OTC waged a war from 1988 to 1990, and it was fought) Tj
T* (   in many ways.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Sometimes an OTC operator would break into a hacker's on-line session) Tj
T* (   demanding to know who was really using the account. Sometimes the) Tj
T* (   operators sent insulting messages to the hackers--and the hackers gave) Tj
T* (   it right back to them. They broke into the hacker's session with `Oh,) Tj
T* (   you idiots are at it again'. The operators couldn't keep the hackers) Tj
T* (   out, but they had other ways of getting even.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron, a Melbourne hacker and rising star in the Australian) Tj

T* (   been playing a game called Empire on the Altos system, a popular) Tj
T* (   hang-out for hackers. It was his first attempt at Empire, a complex) Tj
T* (   war game of strategy which attracted players from around the world.) Tj
T* (   They each had less than one hour per day to conquer regions while) Tj

T* (   packet-sniffer to monitor the hacker's login and capture his password to) Tj
T* (   Empire. Instead of trading the usual insults, the operator had waited) Tj
T* (   for the hacker to logoff and then had hacked into the game and destroyed) Tj
T* (   the hacker's position.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron was furious. He had been so proud of his position in his very) Tj
T* (   first game. Still, wreaking havoc on the Minerva system in retribution) Tj
T* (   was out of the question. Despite the fact that they wasted weeks of) Tj
T* (   his work, Electron had no desire to damage their system. He considered) Tj
T* (   himself lucky to be able to use it as long as he did.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The anti-establishment attitudes nurtured in BBSes such as PI and Zen) Tj
T* (   fed on a love of the new and untried. There was no bitterness, just a) Tj
T* (   desire to throw off the mantle of the old and dive into the new.) Tj
T* (   Camaraderie grew from the exhilarating sense that the youth in this) Tj
T* (   particular time and place were constantly on the edge of big) Tj
T* (   discoveries. People were calling up computers with their modems and) Tj
T* (   experimenting. What did this key sequence do? What about that tone?) Tj
T* (   What would happen if ... It was the question which drove them to stay) Tj
T* (   up day and night, poking and prodding. These hackers didn't for the) Tj
T* (   most part do drugs. They didn't even drink that much, given their age.) Tj
T* (   All of that would have interfered with their burning desire to know,) Tj
T* (   would have dulled their sharp edge. The underground's) Tj
T* (   anti-establishment views were mostly directed at organisations which) Tj
T* (   seemed to block the way to the new frontier--organisations like) Tj
T* (   Telecom.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was a powerful word. Say `Telecom' to a member of the computer) Tj
T* (   underground from that era and you will observe the most striking) Tj
T* (   reaction. Instant contempt sweeps across his face. There is a pause as) Tj
T* (   his lips curl into a noticeable sneer and he replies with complete) Tj
T* (   derision, `Telescum'. The underground hated Australia's national) Tj
T* (   telephone carrier with a passion equalled only to its love of) Tj
T* (   exploration. They felt that Telecom was backward and its staff had no) Tj
T* (   idea how to use their own telecommunications technology. Worst of all,) Tj
T* (   Telecom seemed to actively dislike BBSes.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Line noise interfered with one modem talking to another, and in the) Tj
T* (   eyes of the computer underground, Telecom was responsible for the line) Tj
T* (   noise. A hacker might be reading a message on PI, and there, in the) Tj
T* (   middle of some juicy technical titbit, would be a bit of crud--random) Tj
T* (   characters `2'28 v'1';D>nj4'--followed by the comment, `Line noise.) Tj
T* (   Damn Telescum! At their best as usual, I see'. Sometimes the line) Tj
T* (   noise was so bad it logged the hacker off, thus forcing him to spend) Tj
T* (   another 45 minutes attack dialling the BBS. The modems didn't have) Tj
T* (   error correction, and the faster the modem speed, the worse the impact) Tj
T* (   of line noise. Often it became a race to read mail and post messages) Tj
T* (   before Telecom's line noise logged the hacker off.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Rumours flew through the underground again and again that Telecom was) Tj
T* (   trying to bring in timed local calls. The volume of outrage was) Tj
T* (   deafening. The BBS community believed it really irked the national) Tj
T* (   carrier that people could spend an hour logged into a BBS for the cost) Tj
T* (   of one local phone call. Even more heinous, other rumours abounded) Tj
T* (   that Telecom had forced at least one BBS to limit each incoming call) Tj
T* (   to under half an hour. Hence Telecom's other nickname in the computer) Tj

T* (   underground: Teleprofit.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   To the BBS community, Telecom's Protective Services Unit was the) Tj
T* (   enemy. They were the electronic police. The underground saw Protective) Tj
T* (   Services as `the enforcers'--an all-powerful government force which) Tj
T* (   could raid your house, tap your phone line and seize your computer) Tj
T* (   equipment at any time. The ultimate reason to hate Telecom.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   There was such hatred of Telecom that people in the computer) Tj
T* (   underground routinely discussed ways of sabotaging the carrier. Some) Tj
T* (   people talked of sending 240 volts of electricity down the telephone) Tj
T* (   line--an act which would blow up bits of the telephone exchange along) Tj
T* (   with any line technicians who happened to be working on the cable at) Tj
T* (   the time. Telecom had protective fuses which stopped electrical surges) Tj
T* (   on the line, but BBS hackers had reportedly developed circuit plans) Tj
T* (   which would allow high-frequency voltages to bypass them. Other) Tj
T* (   members of the underground considered what sweet justice it would be) Tj
T* (   to set fire to all the cables outside a particular Telecom exchange) Tj
T* (   which had an easily accessible cable entrance duct.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was against this backdrop that the underground began to shift into) Tj
T* (   phreaking. Phreaking is loosely defined as hacking the telephone) Tj
T* (   system. It is a very loose definition. Some people believe phreaking) Tj
T* (   includes stealing a credit card number and using it to make a) Tj
T* (   long-distance call for free. Purists shun this definition. To them,) Tj
T* (   using a stolen credit card is not phreaking, it is carding. They argue) Tj
T* (   that phreaking demands a reasonable level of technical skill and) Tj
T* (   involves manipulation of a telephone exchange. This manipulation may) Tj
T* (   manifest itself as using computers or electrical circuits to generate) Tj
T* (   special tones or modify the voltage of a phone line. The manipulation) Tj
T* (   changes how the telephone exchange views a particular telephone) Tj
T* (   line. The result: a free and hopefully untraceable call. The purist) Tj
T* (   hacker sees phreaking more as a way of eluding telephone traces than of) Tj
T* (   calling his or her friends around the world for free.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The first transition into phreaking and eventually carding happened) Tj
T* (   over a period of about six months in 1988. Early hackers on PI and Zen) Tj
T* (   relied primarily on dial-outs, like those at Melbourne University or) Tj
T* (   Telecom's Clayton office, to bounce around international computer) Tj
T* (   sites. They also used X.25 dial-outs in other countries--the US,) Tj
T* (   Sweden and Germany--to make another leap in their international) Tj
T* (   journeys.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Gradually, the people running these dial-out lines wised up. Dial-outs) Tj
T* (   started drying up. Passwords were changed. Facilities were cancelled.) Tj
T* (   But the hackers didn't want to give up access to overseas systems.) Tj
T* (   They'd had their first taste of international calling and they wanted) Tj
T* (   more. There was a big shiny electronic world to explore out there.) Tj
T* (   They began trying different methods of getting where they wanted to) Tj
T* (   go. And so the Melbourne underground moved into phreaking.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phreakers swarmed to PABXes like bees to honey. A PABX, a private) Tj
T* (   automatic branch exchange, works like a mini-Telecom telephone) Tj
T* (   exchange. Using a PABX, the employee of a large company could dial) Tj
T* (   another employee in-house without incurring the cost of a local) Tj
T* (   telephone call. If the employee was, for example, staying in a hotel) Tj
T* (   out of town, the company might ask him to make all his calls through) Tj
T* (   the company's PABX to avoid paying extortionate hotel long-distance) Tj
T* (   rates. If the employee was in Brisbane on business, he could dial a) Tj
T* (   Brisbane number which might route him via the company's PABX to) Tj

T* (   Sydney. From there, he might dial out to Rome or London, and the) Tj
T* (   charge would be billed directly to the company. What worked for an) Tj
T* (   employee also worked for a phreaker.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A phreaker dialling into the PABX would generally need to either know) Tj
T* (   or guess the password allowing him to dial out again. Often, the) Tj
T* (   phreaker was greeted by an automated message asking for the employee's) Tj
T* (   telephone extension--which also served as the password. Well, that was) Tj
T* (   easy enough. The phreaker simply tried a series of numbers until he) Tj
T* (   found one which actually worked.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Occasionally, a PABX system didn't even have passwords. The managers) Tj
T* (   of the PABX figured that keeping the phone number secret was good) Tj
T* (   enough security. Sometimes phreakers made free calls out of PABXes) Tj
T* (   simply by exploited security flaws in a particular model or brand of) Tj
T* (   PABX. A series of specific key presses allowed the phreaker to get in) Tj
T* (   without knowing a password, an employee's name, or even the name of) Tj
T* (   the company for that matter.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As a fashionable pastime on BBSes, phreaking began to surpass hacking.) Tj
T* (   PI established a private phreaking section. For a while, it became) Tj
T* (   almost old hat to call yourself a hacker. Phreaking was forging the) Tj
T* (   path forward.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Somewhere in this transition, the Phreakers Five sprung to life. A) Tj
T* (   group of five hackers-turned-phreakers gathered in an exclusive group) Tj
T* (   on PI. Tales of their late-night podding adventures leaked into the) Tj
T* (   other areas of the BBS and made would-be phreakers green with) Tj
T* (   jealousy.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   First, the phreakers would scout out a telephone pod--the grey steel,) Tj
T* (   rounded box perched nondescriptly on most streets. Ideally, the chosen) Tj
T* (   pod would be by a park or some other public area likely to be deserted) Tj
T* (   at night. Pods directly in front of suburban houses were a bit) Tj
T* (   risky--the house might contain a nosy little old lady with a penchant) Tj
T* (   for calling the local police if anything looked suspicious. And what) Tj
T* (   she would see, if she peered out from behind her lace curtains, was a) Tj
T* (   small tornado of action.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   One of the five would leap from the van and open the pod with a key) Tj
T* (   begged, borrowed or stolen from a Telecom technician. The keys seemed) Tj
T* (   easy enough to obtain. The BBSes message boards were rife with gleeful) Tj
T* (   tales of valuable Telecom equipment, such as 500 metres of cable or a) Tj
T* (   pod key, procured off a visiting Telecom repairman either through) Tj
T* (   legitimate means or in exchange for a six-pack of beer.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The designated phreaker would poke inside the pod until he found) Tj
T* (   someone else's phone line. He'd strip back the cable, whack on a pair) Tj
T* (   of alligator clips and, if he wanted to make a voice call, run it to a) Tj
T* (   linesman's handset also borrowed, bought or stolen from Telecom. If he) Tj
T* (   wanted to call another computer instead of talking voice, he would) Tj
T* (   need to extend the phone line back to the phreakers' car. This is) Tj
T* (   where the 500 metres of Telecom cable came in handy. A long cable) Tj
T* (   meant the car, containing five anxious, whispering young men and a) Tj
T* (   veritable junkyard of equipment, would not have to sit next to the pod) Tj
T* (   for hours on end. That sort of scene might look a little suspicious to) Tj
T* (   a local resident out walking his or her dog late one night.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The phreaker ran the cable down the street and, if possible, around) Tj
T* (   the corner. He pulled it into the car and attached it to the waiting) Tj

T* (   computer modem. At least one of the five was proficient enough with) Tj
T* (   electronics hardware to have rigged up the computer and modem to the) Tj

T* (   being traced or billed. The phone call charges would appear at the end) Tj

T* (   clips and battery adaptors in tow, but that didn't matter so much. In) Tj
T* (   fact, the thrill of such a cloak-and-dagger operation was as good as) Tj
T* (   the actual hacking itself. It was illicit. In the phreakers' own eyes,) Tj
T* (   it was clever. And therefore it was fun.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Craig Bowen didn't think much of the Phreakers Five's style of) Tj
T* (   phreaking. In fact, the whole growth of phreaking as a pastime) Tj
T* (   depressed him a bit. He believed it just didn't require the technical) Tj
T* (   skills of proper hacking. Hacking was, in his view, about the) Tj
T* (   exploration of a brave new world of computers. Phreaking was, well, a) Tj
T* (   bit beneath a good hacker. Somehow it demeaned the task at hand.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Still, he could see how in some cases it was necessary in order to) Tj
T* (   continue hacking. Most people in the underground developed some basic) Tj
T* (   skills in phreaking, though people like Bowen always viewed it more as) Tj
T* (   a means to an end--just a way of getting from computer A to computer) Tj
T* (   B, nothing more. Nonetheless, he allowed phreaking discussion areas in) Tj
T* (   the private sections of PI.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   What he refused to allow was discussion areas around credit card) Tj
T* (   fraud. Carding was anathema to Bowen and he watched with alarm as some) Tj
T* (   members of the underground began to shift from phreaking into carding.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Like the transition into phreaking, the move into carding was a) Tj
T* (   logical progression. It occurred over a period of perhaps six months) Tj
T* (   in 1988 and was as obvious as a group of giggling schoolgirls.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Many phreakers saw it simply as another type of phreaking. In fact it) Tj
T* (   was a lot less hassle than manipulating some company's PABX. Instead,) Tj
T* (   you just call up an operator, give him some stranger's credit card) Tj
T* (   number to pay for the call, and you were on your way. Of course, the) Tj
T* (   credit cards had a broader range of uses than the PABXes. The advent) Tj
T* (   of carding meant you could telephone your friends in the US or UK and) Tj
T* (   have a long voice conference call with all of them) Tj
T* (   simultaneously--something which could be a lot tougher to arrange on a) Tj
T* (   PABX. There were other benefits. You could actually charge things with) Tj
T* (   that credit card. As in goods. Mail order goods.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   One member of the underground who used the handle Ivan Trotsky,) Tj
T* (   allegedly ordered $50000 worth of goods, including a jet ski, from the) Tj
T* (   US on a stolen card, only to leave it sitting on the Australian docks.) Tj
T* (   The Customs guys don't tend to take stolen credit cards for duty) Tj
T* (   payments. In another instance, Trotsky was allegedly more successful.) Tj
T* (   A try-hard hacker who kept pictures of Karl Marx and Lenin taped to) Tj
T* (   the side of his computer terminal, Trotsky regularly spewed communist) Tj
T* (   doctrine across the underground. A self-contained paradox, he spent) Tj
T* (   his time attending Communist Party of Australia meetings and duck) Tj
T* (   shoots. According to one hacker, Trotsky's particular contribution to) Tj
T* (   the overthrow of the capitalist order was the arrangement of a) Tj
T* (   shipment of expensive modems from the US using stolen credit cards. He) Tj
T* (   was rumoured to have made a tidy profit by selling the modems in the) Tj
T* (   computer community for about $200 each. Apparently, being part of the) Tj
T* (   communist revolution gave him all sorts of ready-made) Tj

T* (   rationalisations. Membership has its advantages.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   To Bowen, carding was little more than theft. Hacking may have been a) Tj
T* (   moral issue, but in early 1988 in Australia it was not yet much of a) Tj
T* (   legal one. Carding was by contrast both a moral and a legal issue.) Tj
T* (   Bowen recognised that some people viewed hacking as a type of) Tj
T* (   theft--stealing someone else's computer resources--but the argument) Tj
T* (   was ambiguous. What if no-one needed those resources at 2 a.m. on a) Tj
T* (   given night? It might be seen more as `borrowing' an under-used asset,) Tj
T* (   since the hacker had not permanently appropriated any property. Not so) Tj
T* (   for carding.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   What made carding even less noble was that it required the technical) Tj
T* (   skill of a wind-up toy. Not only was it beneath most good hackers, it) Tj
T* (   attracted the wrong sort of people into the hacking scene. People who) Tj
T* (   had little or no respect for the early Australian underground's golden) Tj
T* (   rules of hacking: don't damage computer systems you break into) Tj
T* (   \(including crashing them\); don't change the information in those) Tj
T* (   systems \(except for altering logs to cover your tracks\); and share) Tj
T* (   information. For most early Australian hackers, visiting someone) Tj
T* (   else's system was a bit like visiting a national park. Leave it as you) Tj
T* (   find it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   While the cream seemed to rise to the top of the hacking hierarchy, it) Tj
T* (   was the scum that floated at the top of the carding community. Few) Tj
T* (   people in the underground typified this more completely than Blue) Tj
T* (   Thunder, who had been hanging around the outskirts of the Melbourne) Tj
T* (   underground since at least 1986. The senior hackers treated Blue) Tj
T* (   Blunder, as they sometimes called him, with great derision.) Tj

T* (   His entrance into the underground was as ignominious as that of a) Tj
T* (   debutante who, delicately descending the grand steps of the ballroom,) Tj
T* (   trips and tumbles head-first onto the dance floor. He picked a fight) Tj
T* (   with the grande doyenne of the Melbourne underground.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The Real Article occupied a special place in the underground. For) Tj
T* (   starters, The Real Article was a woman--perhaps the only female to) Tj
T* (   play a major role in the early Melbourne underground scene. Although) Tj
T* (   she didn't hack computers, she knew a lot about them. She ran The Real) Tj
T* (   Connection, a BBS frequented by many of the hackers who hung out on) Tj
T* (   PI. She wasn't somebody's sister wafting in and out of the picture in) Tj
T* (   search of a boyfriend. She was older. She was as good as married. She) Tj
T* (   had kids. She was a force to be reckoned with in the hacking) Tj
T* (   community.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Forthright and formidable, The Real Article commanded considerable) Tj
T* (   respect among the underground. A good indicator of this respect was the) Tj
T* (   fact that the members of H.A.C.K. had inducted her as an honorary member) Tj
T* (   of their exclusive club. Perhaps it was because she ran a popular) Tj
T* (   board. More likely it was because, for all their bluff and bluster, most) Tj
T* (   hackers were young men with the problems of young men.  Being older and) Tj
T* (   wiser, The Real Article knew how to lend a sympathetic ear to those) Tj
T* (   problems. As a woman and a non-hacker, she was removed from the jumble) Tj
T* (   of male ego hierarchical problems associated with confiding in a) Tj
T* (   peer. She served as a sort of mother to the embryonic hacking community,) Tj
T* (   but she was young enough to avoid the judgmental pitfalls most parents) Tj
T* (   fall into with children.) Tj

T* (   partnership worked. Blue Thunder used to bring his high-school essays) Tj
T* (   over for her to proofread and correct. But a short time into the) Tj
T* (   partnership, it went sour. The Real Article didn't like Blue Thunder's) Tj
T* (   approach to running a BBS, which appeared to her to be get information) Tj
T* (   from other hackers and then dump them. The specific strategy seemed to) Tj
T* (   be: get hackers to logon and store their valuable information on the) Tj
T* (   BBS, steal that information and then lock them out of their own) Tj
T* (   account. By locking them out, he was able to steal all the glory; he) Tj

T* (   with Blue Thunder and excommunicated him from her BBS.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Not long after, The Real Article started getting harassing phone calls) Tj
T* (   at 4 in the morning. The calls were relentless. Four a.m. on the dot,) Tj
T* (   every night. The voice at the other end of the line was computer) Tj
T* (   synthesised. This was followed by a picture of a machine-gun, printed) Tj
T* (   out on a cheap dot matrix printer in Commodore ASCII, delivered in her) Tj
T* (   letterbox. There was a threatening message attached which read) Tj
T* (   something like, `If you want the kids to stay alive, get them out of) Tj
T* (   the house'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After that came the brick through the window. It landed in the back of) Tj
T* (   her TV. Then she woke up one morning to find her phone line dead.) Tj
T* (   Someone had opened the Telecom well in the nature strip across the) Tj
T* (   road and cut out a metre of cable. It meant the phone lines for the) Tj
T* (   entire street were down.) Tj

T* (   The Real Article tended to rise above the petty games that whining) Tj
T* (   adolescent boys with bruised egos could play, but this was too much.) Tj
T* (   She called in Telecom Protective Services, who put a last party) Tj
T* (   release on her phone line to trace the early-morning harassing calls.) Tj
T* (   She suspected Blue Thunder was involved, but nothing was ever proved.) Tj
T* (   Finally, the calls stopped. She voiced her suspicions to others in the) Tj
T* (   computer underground. Whatever shred of reputation Blue Chunder, as he) Tj
T* (   then became known for a time, had was soon decimated.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Since his own technical contributions were seen by his fellow BBS) Tj
T* (   users as limited, Blue Thunder would likely have faded into obscurity,) Tj
T* (   condemned to spend the rest of his time in the underground jumping) Tj
T* (   around the ankles of the aristocratic hackers. But the birth of) Tj
T* (   carding arrived at a fortuitous moment for him and he got into carding) Tj
T* (   in a big way, so big in fact that he soon got busted.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   People in the underground recognised him as a liability, both because) Tj
T* (   of what many hackers saw as his loose morals and because he was) Tj
T* (   boastful of his activities. One key hacker said, `He seemed to relish) Tj
T* (   the idea of getting caught. He told people he worked for a credit) Tj
T* (   union and that he stole lots of credit card numbers. He sold) Tj
T* (   information, such as accounts on systems, for financial gain.' In) Tj
T* (   partnership with a carder, he also allegedly sent a bouquet of flowers) Tj

T* (   she would appear as a character witness for the defence. She looked) Tj
T* (   him straight in the eye and said, `I think you would prefer it if I) Tj
T* (   didn't'. He landed 200 hours of community service and an order to pay) Tj
T* (   $706 in costs.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Craig Bowen didn't like where the part of the underground typified by) Tj
T* (   Blue Thunder was headed. In his view, Chunder and Trotsky stood out as) Tj
T* (   bad apples in an otherwise healthy group, and they signalled an) Tj
T* (   unpleasant shift towards selling information. This was perhaps the) Tj
T* (   greatest taboo. It was dirty. It was seedy. It was the realm of) Tj
T* (   criminals, not explorers. The Australian computer underground had) Tj
T* (   started to lose some of its fresh-faced innocence.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Somewhere in the midst of all this, a new player entered the Melbourne) Tj
T* (   underground. His name was Stuart Gill, from a company called) Tj
T* (   Hackwatch.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Bowen met Stuart through Kevin Fitzgerald, a well-known local hacker) Tj
T* (   commentator who founded the Chisholm Institute of Technology's) Tj
T* (   Computer Abuse Research Bureau, which later became the Australian) Tj
T* (   Computer Abuse Research Bureau. After seeing a newspaper article) Tj
T* (   quoting Fitzgerald, Craig decided to ring up the man many members of) Tj
T* (   the underground considered to be a hacker-catcher. Why not? There were) Tj
T* (   no federal laws in Australia against hacking, so Bowen didn't feel) Tj
T* (   that nervous about it. Besides, he wanted to meet the enemy. No-one) Tj
T* (   from the Australian underground had ever done it before, and Bowen) Tj
T* (   decided it was high time. He wanted to set the record straight with) Tj
T* (   Fitzgerald, to let him know what hackers were really on about. They) Tj
T* (   began to talk periodically on the phone.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Along the way, Bowen met Stuart Gill who said that he was working with) Tj
T* (   Fitzgerald.4 Before long, Gill began visiting PI. Eventually, Bowen) Tj
T* (   visited Gill in person at the Mount Martha home he shared with his) Tj
T* (   elderly aunt and uncle. Stuart had all sorts of computer equipment) Tj
T* (   hooked up there, and a great number of boxes of papers in the garage.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Oh, hello there, Paul,' Gill's ancient-looking uncle said when he saw) Tj
T* (   the twosome. As soon as the old man had tottered off, Gill pulled) Tj
T* (   Bowen aside confidentially.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Don't worry about old Eric,' he said. `He lost it in the war. Today) Tj
T* (   he thinks I'm Paul, tomorrow it will be someone else.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Bowen nodded, understanding.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   There were many strange things about Stuart Gill, all of which seemed) Tj
T* (   to have a rational explanation, yet that explanation somehow never) Tj
T* (   quite answered the question in full.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Aged in his late thirties, he was much older and far more worldly than) Tj
T* (   Craig Bowen. He had very, very pale skin--so pasty it looked as though) Tj
T* (   he had never sat in the sun in his life.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Gill drew Bowen into the complex web of his life. Soon he told the) Tj
T* (   young hacker that he wasn't just running Hackwatch, he was also) Tj
T* (   involved in intelligence work. For the Australian Federal Police. For) Tj
T* (   ASIO. For the National Crime Authority. For the Victoria Police's) Tj
T* (   Bureau of Criminal Intelligence \(BCI\). He showed Bowen some secret) Tj
T* (   computer files and documents, but he made him sign a special form) Tj

T* (   first--a legal-looking document demanding non-disclosure based on some) Tj
T* (   sort of official secrets act.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Bowen was impressed. Why wouldn't he be? Gill's cloak-and-dagger world) Tj
T* (   looked like the perfect boy's own adventure. Even bigger and better) Tj
T* (   than hacking. He was a little strange, but that was part of the) Tj
T* (   allure.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Like the time they took a trip to Sale together around Christmas 1988.) Tj
T* (   Gill told Bowen he had to get out of town for a few days--certain) Tj
T* (   undesirable people were after him. He didn't drive, so could Craig) Tj
T* (   help him out? Sure, no problem. They had shared an inexpensive motel) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Being so close to Christmas, Stuart told Craig he had brought him two) Tj
T* (   presents. Craig opened the first--a John Travolta fitness book. When) Tj
T* (   Craig opened the second gift, he was a little stunned. It was a red) Tj
T* (   G-string for men. Craig didn't have a girlfriend at the time--perhaps) Tj
T* (   Stuart was trying to help him get one.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Oh, ah, thanks,' Craig said, a bit confused.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Glad you like it,' Stuart said. `Go on. Try it on.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Try it on?' Craig was now very confused.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yeah, mate, you know, to see if it fits. That's all.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Oh, um, right.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Craig hesitated. He didn't want to seem rude. It was a weird request,) Tj
T* (   but never having been given a G-string before, he didn't know the) Tj
T* (   normal protocol. After all, when someone gives you a jumper, it's) Tj
T* (   normal for them to ask you to try it on, then and there, to see if it) Tj
T* (   fits.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Craig tried it on. Quickly.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yes, seems to fit,' Stuart said matter of factly, then turned away.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Craig felt relieved. He changed back into his clothing.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   That night, and on many others during their trips or during Craig's) Tj
T* (   overnight visits to Stuart's uncle's house, Craig lay in bed wondering) Tj
T* (   about his secretive new friend.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Stuart was definitely a little weird, but he seemed to like women so) Tj
T* (   Craig figured he couldn't be interested in Craig that way. Stuart) Tj
T* (   bragged that he had a very close relationship with a female newspaper) Tj
T* (   reporter, and he always seemed to be chatting up the girl at the video) Tj
T* (   store.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Craig tried not to read too much into Stuart's odd behaviour, for the) Tj
T* (   young man was willing to forgive his friend's eccentricities just to) Tj
T* (   be part of the action. Soon Stuart asked Craig for access to) Tj
T* (   PI--unrestricted access.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The idea made Craig uncomfortable, but Stuart was so persuasive. How) Tj
T* (   would he be able to continue his vital intelligence work without) Tj
T* (   access to Victoria's most important hacking board? Besides, Stuart) Tj

T* (   company's computer system grunted and toiled with everyday labours,) Tj
T* (   this corner of the machine was reserved for live on-line chatting. For) Tj
T* (   free. It was like an early form of the Internet Relay Chat. The) Tj
T* (   company probably hadn't meant to become the world's most prestigious) Tj
T* (   hacker hang-out, but it soon ended up doing so.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Altos was the first significant international live chat channel, and) Tj
T* (   for most hackers it was an amazing thing. The good hackers had cruised) Tj
T* (   through lots of computer networks around the world. Sometimes they) Tj
T* (   bumped into one another on-line and exchanged the latest gossip.) Tj
T* (   Occasionally, they logged into overseas BBSes, where they posted) Tj
T* (   messages. But Altos was different. While underground BBSes had a) Tj
T* (   tendency to simply disappear one day, gone forever, Altos was always) Tj
T* (   there. It was live. Instantaneous communications with a dozen other) Tj
T* (   hackers from all sorts of exotic places. Italy. Canada. France.) Tj
T* (   England. Israel. The US. And all these people not only shared an) Tj
T* (   interest in computer networks but also a flagrant contempt for) Tj
T* (   authority of any type. Instant, real-time penpals--with attitude.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   However, Altos was more exclusive than the average underground BBS.) Tj
T* (   Wanna-be hackers had trouble getting into it because of the way X.25) Tj
T* (   networks were billed. Some systems on the network took reverse-charge) Tj
T* (   connections--like a 1-800 number--and some, including Altos, didn't.) Tj
T* (   To get to Altos you needed a company's NUI \(Network User Identifier\),) Tj
T* (   which was like a calling card number for the X.25 network, used to) Tj
T* (   bill your time on-line. Or you had to have access to a system like) Tj
T* (   Minerva which automatically accepted billing for all the connections) Tj
T* (   made.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   X.25 networks are different in various ways from the Internet, which) Tj
T* (   developed later. X.25 networks use different communication protocols) Tj
T* (   and, unlike the Internet at the user-level, they only use addresses) Tj
T* (   containing numbers not letters. Each packet of information travelling) Tj
T* (   over a data network needs to be encased in a particular type of) Tj
T* (   envelope. A `letter' sent across the X.25 network needs an X.25) Tj
T* (   `stamped' envelope, not an Internet `stamped' envelope.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The X.25 networks were controlled by a few very large players,) Tj
T* (   companies such as Telenet and Tymnet, while the modern Internet is, by) Tj
T* (   contrast, a fragmented collection of many small and medium-sized) Tj
T* (   sites.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Altos unified the international hacking world as nothing else had) Tj
T* (   done. In sharing information about their own countries' computers and) Tj
T* (   networks, hackers helped each other venture further and further) Tj
T* (   abroad. The Australians had gained quite a reputation on Altos. They) Tj
T* (   knew their stuff. More importantly, they possessed DEFCON, a program) Tj
T* (   which mapped out uncharted networks and scanned for accounts on) Tj
T* (   systems within them. Force wrote DEFCON based on a simple automatic) Tj
T* (   scanning program provided by his friend and mentor, Craig Bowen) Tj
T* (   \(Thunderbird1\).) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Like the telephone system, the X.25 networks had a large number of) Tj
T* (   `phone numbers', called network user addresses \(NUAs\). Most were not) Tj
T* (   valid. They simply hadn't been assigned to anyone yet. To break into) Tj
T* (   computers on the network, you had to find them first, which meant) Tj
T* (   either hearing about a particular system from a fellow hacker or) Tj
T* (   scanning. Scanning--typing in one possible address after another--was) Tj
T* (   worse than looking for a needle in a haystack. 02624-589004-0004. Then) Tj

T* (   Until you hit a machine at the other end.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Back in 1987 or early 1988, Force had logged into Pacific Island for a) Tj
T* (   talk with Craig Bowen. Force bemoaned the tediousness of hand) Tj
T* (   scanning.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Well, why the hell are you doing it manually?' Bowen responded. `You) Tj
T* (   should just use my program.' He then gave Force the source code for) Tj
T* (   his simple automated scanning program, along with instructions.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Force went through the program and decided it would serve as a good) Tj
T* (   launchpad for bigger things, but it had a major limitation. The) Tj
T* (   program could only handle one connection at a time, which meant it) Tj
T* (   could only scan one branch of a network at a time.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Less than three months later, Force had rewritten Bowen's program into) Tj
T* (   the far more powerful DEFCON, which became the jewel in the crown of) Tj
T* (   the Australian hackers' reputation. With DEFCON, a hacker could) Tj
T* (   automatically scan fifteen or twenty network addresses simultaneously.) Tj
T* (   He could command the computer to map out pieces of the Belgian,) Tj
T* (   British and Greek X.25 communications networks, looking for computers) Tj
T* (   hanging off the networks like buds at the tips of tree branches.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Conceptually, the difference was a little like using a basic PC, which) Tj
T* (   can only run one program at a time, as opposed to operating a more) Tj
T* (   sophisticated one where you can open many windows with different) Tj
T* (   programs running all at once. Even though you might only be working in) Tj
T* (   one window, say, writing a letter, the computer might be doing) Tj
T* (   calculations in a spreadsheet in another window in the background. You) Tj
T* (   can swap between) Tj
T* (   different functions, which are all running in the background) Tj
T* (   simultaneously.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   While DEFCON was busy scanning, Force could do other things, such as) Tj
T* (   talk on Altos. He continued improving DEFCON, writing up to four more) Tj
T* (   versions of the program. Before long, DEFCON didn't just scan twenty) Tj
T* (   different connections at one time; it also automatically tried to) Tj
T* (   break into all the computers it found through those connections.) Tj
T* (   Though the program only tried basic default passwords, it had a fair) Tj
T* (   degree of success, since it could attack so many network addresses at) Tj
T* (   once. Further, new sites and mini-networks were being added so quickly) Tj
T* (   that security often fell by the wayside in the rush to join in. Since) Tj
T* (   the addresses were unpublished, companies often felt this obscurity) Tj
T* (   offered enough protection.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   DEFCON produced lists of thousands of computer sites to raid. Force) Tj
T* (   would leave it scanning from a hacked Prime computer, and a day or two) Tj
T* (   later he would have an output file with 6000 addresses on different) Tj
T* (   networks. He perused the list and selected sites which caught his) Tj
T* (   attention. If his program had discovered an interesting address, he) Tj
T* (   would travel over the X.25 network to the site and then try to break) Tj
T* (   into the computer at that address. Alternatively, DEFCON might have) Tj
T* (   already successfully penetrated the machine using a default password,) Tj
T* (   in which case the address, account name and password would all be) Tj
T* (   waiting for Force in the log file. He could just walk right in.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Everyone on Altos wanted DEFCON, but Force refused to hand over the) Tj
T* (   program. No way was he going to have other hackers tearing up virgin) Tj
T* (   networks. Not even Erik Bloodaxe, one of the leaders of the most) Tj
T* (   prestigious American hacking group, Legion of Doom \(LOD\), got DEFCON) Tj

T* (   king who ruled over the area now known as York, England. Although Erik) Tj
T* (   was on friendly terms with the Australian hackers, Force remained) Tj
T* (   adamant. He would not let the jewel out of his hands.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But on this fateful day in 1988, Par didn't want DEFCON. He wanted the) Tj
T* (   secret Force had just discovered, but held so very close to his chest.) Tj
T* (   And the Australian didn't want to give it to him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Force was a meticulous hacker. His bedroom was remarkably tidy, for a) Tj
T* (   hacker's room. It had a polished, spartan quality. There were a few) Tj
T* (   well-placed pieces of minimalist furniture:) Tj
T* (   a black enamel metal single bed, a modern black bedside) Tj
T* (   table and a single picture on the wall--a photographic poster of) Tj
T* (   lightning, framed in glass. The largest piece of furniture was a) Tj
T* (   blue-grey desk with a return, upon which sat his computer, a printer) Tj
T* (   and an immaculate pile of print-outs. The bookcase, a tall modern) Tj
T* (   piece matching the rest of the furniture, contained an extensive) Tj
T* (   collection of fantasy fiction books, including what seemed to be) Tj
T* (   almost everything ever written by David Eddings. The lower shelves) Tj
T* (   housed assorted chemistry and programming books. A chemistry award) Tj
T* (   proudly jutted out from the shelf housing a few Dungeons and Dragons) Tj
T* (   books.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He kept his hacking notes in an orderly set of plastic folders, all) Tj
T* (   filed in the bottom of his bookcase. Each page of notes, neatly) Tj
T* (   printed and surrounded by small, tidy handwriting revealing updates) Tj
T* (   and minor corrections, had its own plastic cover to prevent smudges or) Tj
T* (   stains.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Force thought it was inefficient to hand out his DEFCON program and) Tj
T* (   have ten people scan the same network ten different times. It wasted) Tj
T* (   time and resources. Further, it was becoming harder to get access to) Tj
T* (   the main X.25 sites in Australia, like Minerva. Scanning was the type) Tj
T* (   of activity likely to draw the attention of a system admin and result) Tj
T* (   in the account being killed. The more people who scanned, the more) Tj
T* (   accounts would be killed, and the less access the Australian hackers) Tj
T* (   would have. So Force refused to hand over DEFCON to hackers outside) Tj
T* (   The Realm, which is one thing that made it such a powerful group.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Scanning with DEFCON meant using Netlink, a program which legitimate) Tj
T* (   users didn't often employ. In his hunt for hackers, an admin might) Tj
T* (   look for people running Netlink, or he might just examine which) Tj
T* (   systems a user was connecting to. For example, if a hacker connected) Tj
T* (   directly to Altos from Minerva without hopping through a respectable) Tj
T* (   midpoint, such as another corporate machine overseas, he could count) Tj
T* (   on the Minerva admins killing off the account.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   DEFCON was revolutionary for its time, and difficult to reproduce. It) Tj
T* (   was written for Prime computers, and not many hackers knew how to) Tj
T* (   write programs for Primes. In fact, it was exceedingly difficult for) Tj
T* (   most hackers to learn programming of any sort for large, commercial) Tj
T* (   machines. Getting the system engineering manuals was tough work and) Tj
T* (   many of the large companies guarded their manuals almost as trade) Tj
T* (   secrets. Sure, if you bought a $100000 system, the company would give) Tj

T* (   Learning on-line was slow and almost as difficult. Most hackers used) Tj
T* (   300 or 1200 baud modems. Virtually all access to these big, expensive) Tj
T* (   machines was illegal. Every moment on-line was a risky proposition.) Tj
T* (   High schools never had these sorts of expensive machines. Although) Tj
T* (   many universities had systems, the administrators were usually miserly) Tj
T* (   with time on-line for students. In most cases, students only got) Tj
T* (   accounts on the big machines in their second year of computer science) Tj
T* (   studies. Even then, student accounts were invariably on the) Tj
T* (   university's oldest, clunkiest machine. And if you weren't a comp-sci) Tj
T* (   student, forget it. Indulging your intellectual curiosity in VMS) Tj
T* (   systems would never be anything more than a pipe dream.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Even if you did manage to overcome all the roadblocks and develop some) Tj
T* (   programming experience in VMS systems, for example, you might only be) Tj
T* (   able to access a small number of machines on any given network. The) Tj
T* (   X.25 networks connected a large number of machines which used very) Tj
T* (   different operating systems. Many, such as Primes, were not in the) Tj
T* (   least bit intuitive. So if you knew VMS and you hit a Prime machine,) Tj
T* (   well, that was pretty much it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Unless, of course, you happened to belong to a clan of hackers like) Tj
T* (   The Realm. Then you could call up the BBS and post a message. `Hey, I) Tj
T* (   found a really cool Primos system at this address. Ran into problems) Tj
T* (   trying to figure the parameters of the Netlink command. Ideas anyone?') Tj
T* (   And someone from your team would step forward to help.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In The Realm, Force tried to assemble a diverse group of Australia's) Tj
T* (   best hackers, each with a different area of expertise. And he happened) Tj
T* (   to be the resident expert in Prime computers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Although Force wouldn't give DEFCON to anyone outside The Realm, he) Tj
T* (   wasn't unreasonable. If you weren't in the system but you had an) Tj
T* (   interesting network you wanted mapped, he would scan it for you. Force) Tj
T* (   referred to scans for network user addresses as `NUA sprints'. He) Tj
T* (   would give you a copy of the NUA sprint. While he was at it, he would) Tj
T* (   also keep a copy for The Realm. That was efficient. Force's pet) Tj
T* (   project was creating a database of systems and networks for The Realm,) Tj
T* (   so he simply added the new information to its database.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Force's great passion was mapping new networks, and new mini-networks) Tj
T* (   were being added to the main X.25 networks all the time. A large) Tj
T* (   corporation, such a BHP, might set up its own small-scale network) Tj
T* (   connecting its offices in Western Australia, Queensland, Victoria and) Tj
T* (   the United Kingdom. That mini-network might be attached to a) Tj
T* (   particular X.25 network, such as Austpac. Get into the Austpac network) Tj
T* (   and chances were you could get into any of the company's sites.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Exploration of all this uncharted territory consumed most of Force's) Tj
T* (   time. There was something cutting-edge, something truly adventurous) Tj
T* (   about finding a new network and carefully piecing together a picture) Tj
T* (   of what the expanding web looked like. He drew detailed pictures and) Tj
T* (   diagrams showing how a new part of the network connected to the rest.) Tj
T* (   Perhaps it appealed to his sense of order, or maybe he was just an) Tj
T* (   adventurer at heart. Whatever the underlying motivation, the maps) Tj
T* (   provided The Realm with yet another highly prized asset.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When he wasn't mapping networks, Force published Australia's first) Tj
T* (   underground hacking journal, Globetrotter. Widely read in the) Tj
T* (   international hacking community, Globetrotter reaffirmed Australian) Tj
T* (   hackers' pre-eminent position in the international underground.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But on this particular day, Par wasn't thinking about getting a copy) Tj
T* (   of Globetrotter or asking Force to scan a network for him. He was) Tj
T* (   thinking about that secret. Force's new secret. The secret Parmaster) Tj
T* (   desperately wanted.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Force had been using DEFCON to scan half a dozen networks while he) Tj
T* (   chatted to Par on Altos. He found an interesting connection from the) Tj
T* (   scan, so he went off to investigate it. When he connected to the) Tj
T* (   unknown computer, it started firing off strings of numbers at Force's) Tj
T* (   machine. Force sat at his desk and watched the characters rush by on) Tj
T* (   his screen.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was very odd. He hadn't done anything. He hadn't sent any commands) Tj
T* (   to the mystery computer. He hadn't made the slightest attempt to break) Tj
T* (   into the machine. Yet here the thing was throwing streams of numbers.) Tj
T* (   What kind of computer was this? There might have been some sort of) Tj
T* (   header which would identify the computer, but it had zoomed by so fast) Tj
T* (   in the unexpected data dump that Force had missed it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Force flipped over to his chat with Par on Altos. He didn't completely) Tj
T* (   trust Par, thinking the friendly American sailed a bit close to the) Tj
T* (   wind. But Par was an expert in X.25 networks and was bound to have) Tj
T* (   some clue about these numbers. Besides, if they turned out to be) Tj
T* (   something sensitive, Force didn't have to tell Par where he found) Tj
T* (   them.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I've just found a bizarre address. It is one strange system. When I) Tj
T* (   connected, it just started shooting off numbers at me. Check these) Tj
T* (   out.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Force didn't know what the numbers were, but Par sure did. `Those look) Tj
T* (   like credit cards,' he typed back.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Oh.' Force went quiet.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par thought the normally chatty Australian hacker seemed astonished.) Tj
T* (   After a short silence, the now curious Par nudged the conversation) Tj
T* (   forward. `I have a way I can check out whether they really are valid) Tj
T* (   cards,' he volunteered. `It'll take some time, but I should be able to) Tj
T* (   do it and get back to you.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yes.' Force seemed hesitant. `OK.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   On the other side of the Pacific from Par, Force thought about this) Tj
T* (   turn of events. If they were valid credit cards, that was very cool.) Tj
T* (   Not because he intended to use them for credit card fraud in the way) Tj
T* (   Ivan Trotsky might have done. But Force could use them for making) Tj
T* (   long-distance phone calls to hack overseas. And the sheer number of) Tj
T* (   cards was astonishing. Thousand and thousands of them. Maybe 10000.) Tj
T* (   All he could think was, Shit! Free connections for the rest of my) Tj
T* (   life.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Hackers such as Force considered using cards to call overseas computer) Tj
T* (   systems a little distasteful, but certainly acceptable. The card owner) Tj
T* (   would never end up paying the bill anyway. The hackers figured that) Tj
T* (   Telecom, which they despised, would probably have to wear the cost in) Tj
T* (   the end, and that was fine by them. Using cards to hack was nothing) Tj
T* (   like ordering consumer goods. That was real credit card fraud. And) Tj
T* (   Force would never sully his hands with that sort of behaviour.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Force scrolled back over his capture of the numbers which had been) Tj
T* (   injected into his machine. After closer inspection, he saw there were) Tj
T* (   headers which appeared periodically through the list. One said,) Tj
T* (   `CitiSaudi'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He checked the prefix of the mystery machine's network address again.) Tj
T* (   He knew from previous scans that it belonged to one of the world's) Tj
T* (   largest banks. Citibank.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The data dump continued for almost three hours. After that, the) Tj
T* (   Citibank machine seemed to go dead. Force saw nothing but a blank) Tj
T* (   screen, but he kept the connection open. There was no way he was going) Tj
T* (   to hang up from this conversation. He figured this had to be a freak) Tj
T* (   connection--that he accidentally connected to this machine somehow,) Tj
T* (   that it wasn't really at the address he had tried based on the DEFCON) Tj
T* (   scan of Citibank's network.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   How else could it have happened? Surely Citibank wouldn't have a) Tj
T* (   computer full of credit cards which spilled its guts every time) Tj
T* (   someone rang up to say `hello'? There would be tonnes of security on a) Tj
T* (   machine like that. This machine didn't even have a password. It didn't) Tj
T* (   even need a special character command, like a secret handshake.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Freak connections happened now and then on X.25) Tj
T* (   networks. They had the same effect as a missed voice phone) Tj
T* (   connection. You dial a friend's number--and you dial it correctly--but) Tj
T* (   somehow the call gets screwed up in the tangle of wires and exchanges) Tj
T* (   and your call gets put through to another number entirely. Of course,) Tj
T* (   once something like that happens to an X.25 hacker, he immediately) Tj
T* (   tries to figure out what the hell is going on, to search every shred) Tj
T* (   of data from the machine looking for the system's real address.) Tj
T* (   Because it was an accident, he suspects he will never find the machine) Tj
T* (   again.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Force stayed home from school for two days to keep the connection) Tj
T* (   alive and to piece together how he landed on the doorstep of this) Tj
T* (   computer. During this time, the Citibank computer woke up a few times,) Tj
T* (   dumped a bit more information, and then went back to sleep. Keeping) Tj
T* (   the connection alive meant running a small risk of discovery by an) Tj
T* (   admin at his launch point, but the rewards in this case far exceeded) Tj
T* (   the risk.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It wasn't all that unusual for Force to skip school to hack. His) Tj
T* (   parents used to tell him, `You better stop it, or you'll have to wear) Tj
T* (   glasses one day'. Still, they didn't seem to worry too much, since) Tj
T* (   their son had always excelled in school without much effort. At the) Tj
T* (   start of his secondary school career he had tried to convince his) Tj
T* (   teachers he should skip year 9. Some objected. It was a hassle, but he) Tj
T* (   finally arranged it by quietly doing the coursework for year 9 while) Tj
T* (   he was in year 8.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After Force had finally disconnected from the CitiSaudi computer and) Tj
T* (   had a good sleep, he decided to check on whether he could reconnect to) Tj
T* (   the machine. At first, no-one answered, but when he tried a little) Tj
T* (   later, someone answered all right. And it was the same talkative) Tj
T* (   resident who answered the door the first time. Although it only seemed) Tj
T* (   to work at certain hours of the day, the Citibank network address was) Tj
T* (   the right one. He was in again.) Tj

T* (   As Force looked over the captures from his Citibank hack, he noticed) Tj
T* (   that the last section of the data dump didn't contain credit card) Tj
T* (   numbers like the first part. It had people's names--Middle Eastern) Tj
T* (   names--and a list of transactions. Dinner at a restaurant. A visit to) Tj
T* (   a brothel. All sorts of transactions. There was also a number which) Tj
T* (   looked like a credit limit, in come cases a very, very large limit,) Tj
T* (   for each person. A sheik and his wife appeared to have credit limits) Tj
T* (   of $1 million--each. Another name had a limit of $5 million.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   There was something strange about the data, Force thought. It was not) Tj
T* (   structured in a way which suggested the Citibank machine was merely) Tj
T* (   transmitting data to another machine. It looked more like a text file) Tj
T* (   which was being dumped from a computer to a line printer.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Force sat back and considered his exquisite discovery. He decided this) Tj
T* (   was something he would share only with a very few close, trusted) Tj
T* (   friends from The Realm. He would tell Phoenix and perhaps one other) Tj
T* (   member, but no-one else.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As he looked through the data once more, Force began to feel a little) Tj
T* (   anxious. Citibank was a huge financial institution, dependent on the) Tj
T* (   complete confidence of its customers. The corporation would lose a lot) Tj
T* (   of face if news of Force's discovery got out. It might care enough to) Tj
T* (   really come after him. Then, with the sudden clarity of the lightning) Tj
T* (   strike photo which hung on his wall, a single thought filled his mind.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   I am playing with fire.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (                                    [ ]) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Where did you get those numbers?' Par asked Force next time they were) Tj
T* (   both on Altos.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Force hedged. Par leaped forward.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I checked those numbers for you. They're valid,' he told Force. The) Tj
T* (   American was more than intrigued. He wanted that network address. It) Tj
T* (   was lust. Next stop, mystery machine. `So, what's the address?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   That was the one question Force didn't want to hear. He and Par had a) Tj
T* (   good relationship, sharing information comfortably if occasionally.) Tj
T* (   But that relationship only went so far. For all he knew, Par might) Tj
T* (   have a less than desirable use for the information. Force didn't know) Tj
T* (   if Par carded, but he felt sure Par had friends who might be into it.) Tj
T* (   So Force refused to tell Par where to find the mystery machine.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par wasn't going to give up all that easily. Not that he would use the) Tj
T* (   cards for free cash, but, hey, the mystery machine seemed like a very) Tj
T* (   cool place to check out. There would be no peace for Force until Par) Tj
T* (   got what he wanted. Nothing is so tempting to a hacker as the faintest) Tj
T* (   whiff of information about a system he wants, and Par hounded Force) Tj
T* (   until the Australian hacker relented just a bit.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Finally Force told Par roughly where DEFCON had been scanning for) Tj
T* (   addresses when it stumbled upon the CitiSaudi machine. Force wasn't) Tj
T* (   handing over the street address, just the name of the suburb. DEFCON) Tj
T* (   had been accessing the Citibank network through Telenet, a large) Tj
T* (   American data network using X.25 communications protocols. The) Tj
T* (   sub-prefixes for the Citibank portion of the network were 223 and 224.) Tj

T* (   Par pestered Force some more for the rest of the numbers, but the) Tj
T* (   Australian had dug his heels in. Force was too careful a player, too) Tj
T* (   fastidious a hacker, to allow himself to get mixed up in the things) Tj
T* (   Par might get up to.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   OK, thought the seventeen-year-old Par, I can do this without you. Par) Tj
T* (   estimated there were 20000 possible addresses on that network, any one) Tj
T* (   of which might be the home of the mystery machine. But he assumed the) Tj
T* (   machine would be in the low end of the network, since the lower) Tj
T* (   numbers were usually used first and the higher numbers were generally) Tj
T* (   saved for other, special network functions. His assumptions narrowed) Tj
T* (   the likely search field to about 2000 possible addresses.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par began hand-scanning on the Citibank Global Telecommunications) Tj
T* (   Network \(GTN\) looking for the mystery machine. Using his knowledge of) Tj
T* (   the X.25 network, he picked a number to start with. He typed 22301,) Tj
T* (   22302, 22303. On and on, heading toward 22310000. Hour after hour,) Tj
T* (   slowly, laboriously, working his way through all the options, Par) Tj
T* (   scanned out a piece, or a range, within the network. When he got bored) Tj
T* (   with the 223 prefix, he tried out the 224 one for a bit of variety.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Bleary-eyed and exhausted after a long night at the computer, Par felt) Tj
T* (   like calling it quits. The sun had splashed through the windows of his) Tj
T* (   Salinas, California, apartment hours ago. His living room was a mess,) Tj
T* (   with empty, upturned beer cans circling his Apple IIe. Par gave up for) Tj
T* (   a while, caught some shut-eye. He had gone through the entire list of) Tj
T* (   possible addresses, knocking at all the doors, and nothing had) Tj
T* (   happened. But over the next few days he returned to scanning the) Tj
T* (   network again. He decided to be more methodical about it and do the) Tj
T* (   whole thing from scratch a second time.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He was part way through the second scan when it happened. Par's) Tj
T* (   computer connected to something. He sat up and peered toward the) Tj
T* (   screen. What was going on? He checked the address. He was sure he had) Tj
T* (   tried this one before and nothing had answered. Things were definitely) Tj
T* (   getting strange. He stared at his computer.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The screen was blank, with the cursor blinking silently at the top.) Tj
T* (   Now what? What had Force done to get the computer to sing its song?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par tried pressing the control key and a few different letters.) Tj
T* (   Nothing. Maybe this wasn't the right address after all. He) Tj
T* (   disconnected from the machine and carefully wrote down the address,) Tj
T* (   determined to try it again later.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   On his third attempt, he connected again but found the same irritating) Tj
T* (   blank screen. This time he went through the entire alphabet with the) Tj
T* (   control key.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Control L.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   That was the magic keystroke. The one that made CitiSaudi give up its) Tj
T* (   mysterious cache. The one that gave Par an adrenalin rush, along with) Tj
T* (   thousands and thousands of cards. Instant cash, flooding his screen.) Tj
T* (   He turned on the screen capture so he could collect all the) Tj
T* (   information flowing past and analyse it later. Par had to keep feeding) Tj
T* (   his little Apple IIe more disks to store all the data coming in) Tj
T* (   through his 1200 baud modem.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was magnificent. Par savoured the moment, thinking about how much) Tj

T* (   Aussie, you aren't the only show in town. See ya in Citibank.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   An hour or so later, when the CitiSaudi data dump had finally) Tj
T* (   finished, Par was stunned at what he found in his capture. These) Tj
T* (   weren't just any old cards. These were debit cards, and they were held) Tj
T* (   by very rich Arabs. These people just plopped a few million in a bank) Tj
T* (   account and linked a small, rectangular piece of plastic to that) Tj
T* (   account. Every charge came directly out of the bank balance. One guy) Tj
T* (   listed in the data dump bought a $330,000 Mercedes Benz in) Tj
T* (   Istanbul--on his card. Par couldn't imagine being able to throw down a) Tj
T* (   bit of plastic for that. Taking that plastic out for a spin around the) Tj
T* (   block would bring a whole new meaning to the expression, `Charge it!') Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   Electron, one of the best Australian hackers of the late 1980s. But) Tj
T* (   Par couldn't help himself. She was irresistible, even though he had) Tj
T* (   never met her in person. Theorem was different. She was smart and) Tj
T* (   funny, but refined, as a European woman can be.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   They met on Altos in 1988.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Theorem didn't hack computers. She didn't need to, since she could) Tj
T* (   connect to Altos through her old university computer account. She had) Tj
T* (   first found Altos on 23 December 1986. She remembered the date for two) Tj
T* (   reasons. First, she was amazed) Tj
T* (   at the power of Altos--that she could have a live conversation on-line) Tj
T* (   with a dozen people in different countries at the same time. Altos was) Tj
T* (   a whole new world for her. Second, that was the day she met Electron.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron made Theorem laugh. His sardonic, irreverent humour hit a) Tj
T* (   chord with her. Traditional Swiss society could be stifling and) Tj
T* (   closed, but Electron was a breath of fresh air. Theorem was Swiss but) Tj
T* (   she didn't always fit the mould. She hated skiing. She was six feet) Tj

T* (   financial institution.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Theorem and Electron talked on Altos for hours at a time. They talked) Tj
T* (   about everything--life, family, movies, parties--but not much about) Tj
T* (   what most people on Altos talked about--hacking. Eventually, Electron) Tj
T* (   gathered up the courage to ask Theorem for her voice telephone number.) Tj
T* (   She gave it to him happily and Electron called her at home in) Tj
T* (   Lausanne. They talked. And talked. And talked. Soon they were on the) Tj
T* (   telephone all the time.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Seventeen-year-old Electron had never had a girlfriend. None of the) Tj
T* (   girls in his middle-class high school would give him the time of day) Tj
T* (   when it came to romance. Yet here was this bright, vibrant girl--a) Tj
T* (   girl who studied maths--speaking to him intimately in a melting French) Tj
T* (   accent. Best of all, she genuinely liked him. A few words from his) Tj
T* (   lips could send her into silvery peals of laughter.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When the phone bill arrived, it was $1000. Electron surreptitiously) Tj
T* (   collected it and buried it at the bottom of a drawer in his bedroom.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When he told Theorem, she offered to help pay for it. A cheque for) Tj
T* (   $700 showed up not long after. It made the task of explaining) Tj
T* (   Telecom's reminder notice to his father much easier.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The romantic relationship progressed throughout 1987 and the first) Tj
T* (   half of 1988. Electron and Theorem exchanged love letters and tender) Tj
T* (   intimacies over 16000 kilometres of computer networks, but the) Tj
T* (   long-distance relationship had some bumpy periods. Like when she had) Tj
T* (   an affair over several months with Pengo. A well-known German hacker) Tj
T* (   with links to the German hacking group called the Chaos Computer Club,) Tj
T* (   Pengo was also a friend and mentor to Electron. Pengo was, however,) Tj
T* (   only a short train ride away from Theorem. She became friends with) Tj
T* (   Pengo on Altos and eventually visited him. Things progressed from) Tj
T* (   there.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Theorem was honest with Electron about the affair, but there was) Tj
T* (   something unspoken, something below the surface. Even after the affair) Tj
T* (   ended, Theorem was sweet on Pengo the way a girl remains fond of her) Tj
T* (   first love regardless of how many other men she has slept with since) Tj
T* (   then.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron felt hurt and angry, but he swallowed his pride and forgave) Tj
T* (   Theorem her dalliance. Eventually, Pengo disappeared from the scene.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pengo had been involved with people who sold US military) Tj
T* (   secrets--taken from computers--to the KGB. Although his direct) Tj
T* (   involvement in the ongoing international computer espionage had been) Tj
T* (   limited, he began to worry about the risks. His real interest was in) Tj
T* (   hacking, not spying. The Russian connection simply enabled him to get) Tj
T* (   access to bigger and better computers. Beyond that, he felt no loyalty) Tj
T* (   to the Russians.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In the first half of 1988, he handed himself in to the German) Tj
T* (   authorities. Under West German law at the time, a citizen-spy who) Tj
T* (   surrendered himself before the state discovered the crime, and thus) Tj
T* (   averted more damage to the state, acquired immunity from prosecution.) Tj
T* (   Having already been busted in December 1986 for using a stolen NUI,) Tj
T* (   Pengo decided that turning himself in would be his best hope of taking) Tj
T* (   advantage of this legal largesse.) Tj

T* (   in March 1989 the twenty-year-old from Berlin was raided again, this) Tj

T* (   and the media exposed Pengo's real name. He didn't know if he would) Tj
T* (   eventually be tried and convicted of something related to the) Tj
T* (   incident. Pengo had a few things on his mind other than the six-foot) Tj
T* (   Swiss girl.) Tj

T* (   With Pengo out of the way, the situation between Theorem and the) Tj
T* (   Australian hacker improved. Until Par came along.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Theorem and Par began innocently enough. Being one of only a few girls) Tj
T* (   in the international hacking and phreaking scene and, more) Tj
T* (   particularly, on Altos, she was treated differently. She had lots of) Tj
T* (   male friends on the German chat system, and the boys told her things) Tj
T* (   in confidence they would never tell each other. They sought out her) Tj
T* (   advice. She often felt like she wore many hats--mother, girlfriend,) Tj
T* (   psychiatrist--when she spoke with the boys on Altos.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par had been having trouble with his on-line girlfriend, Nora, and) Tj
T* (   when he met Theorem he turned to her for a bit of support. He had) Tj
T* (   travelled from California to meet Nora in person in New York. But when) Tj
T* (   he arrived in the sweltering heat of a New York summer, without) Tj
T* (   warning, her conservative Chinese parents didn't take kindly to his) Tj
T* (   unannounced appearance. There were other frictions between Nora and) Tj
T* (   Par. The relationship had been fine on Altos and on the phone, but) Tj
T* (   things were just not clicking in person.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He already knew that virtual relationships, forged over an electronic) Tj
T* (   medium which denied the importance of physical chemistry, could) Tj
T* (   sometimes be disappointing.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par used to hang out on a phone bridge with another Australian member) Tj
T* (   of The Realm, named Phoenix, and with a fun girl from southern) Tj
T* (   California. Tammi, a casual phreaker, had a great personality and a) Tj
T* (   hilarious sense of humour. During those endless hours chatting, she) Tj
T* (   and Phoenix seemed to be in the throes of a mutual crush. In the) Tj
T* (   phreaking underground, they were known as a bit of a virtual item. She) Tj
T* (   had even invited Phoenix to come visit her sometime. Then, one day,) Tj
T* (   for the fun of it, Tammi decided to visit Par in Monterey. Her) Tj
T* (   appearance was a shock.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Tammi had described herself to Phoenix as being a blue-eyed, blonde) Tj
T* (   California girl. Par knew that Phoenix visualised her as a) Tj
T* (   stereotypical bikini-clad, beach bunny from LA. His perception rested) Tj
T* (   on a foreigner's view of the southern California culture. The land of) Tj
T* (   milk and honey. The home of the Beach Boys and TV series like) Tj
T* (   `Charlie's Angels'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Tammi arrived, Par knew instantly that she and Phoenix would) Tj
T* (   never hit it off in person. Tammi did in fact have both blonde hair) Tj
T* (   and blue eyes. She had neglected to mention, however, that she weighed) Tj
T* (   about 300 pounds, had a rather homely face and a somewhat down-market) Tj
T* (   style. Par really liked Tammi, but he couldn't get the ugly phrase) Tj
T* (   `white trash' out of his thoughts. He pushed and shoved, but the) Tj
T* (   phrase was wedged in his mind. It fell to Par to tell Phoenix the) Tj

T* (   virtual relationship.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (   Leaving New York and Nora behind, Par moved across the river to New) Tj
T* (   Jersey to stay with a friend, Byteman, who was one of a group of) Tj
T* (   hackers who specialised in breaking into computer systems run by Bell) Tj
T* (   Communications Research \(Bellcore\). Bellcore came into existence at) Tj
T* (   the beginning of 1984 as a result of the break-up of the US telephone) Tj
T* (   monopoly known as Bell Systems. Before the break-up, Bell Systems') Tj
T* (   paternalistic holding company, American Telephone and Telegraph) Tj
T* (   \(AT&T\), had) Tj
T* (   fostered the best and brightest in Bell Labs, its research arm. Over) Tj
T* (   the course of its history, Bell Labs boasted at least seven) Tj
T* (   Nobel-prize winning researchers and numerous scientific achievements.) Tj
T* (   All of which made Bellcore a good target for hackers trying to prove) Tj
T* (   their prowess.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Byteman used to chat with Theorem on Altos, and eventually he called) Tj
T* (   her, voice. Par must have looked pretty inconsolable, because one day) Tj
T* (   while Byteman was talking to Theorem, he suddenly said to her, `Hey,) Tj
T* (   wanna talk to a friend of mine?' Theorem said `Sure' and Byteman) Tj
T* (   handed the telephone to Par. They talked for about twenty minutes.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After that they spoke regularly both on Altos and on the phone. For) Tj
T* (   weeks after Par returned to California, Theorem tried to cheer him up) Tj
T* (   after his unfortunate experience with Nora. By mid-1988, they had) Tj
T* (   fallen utterly and passionately in love.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron, an occasional member of Force's Realm group, took the news) Tj
T* (   very badly. Not everyone on Altos liked Electron. He could be a little) Tj
T* (   prickly, and very cutting when he chose to be, but he was an ace) Tj
T* (   hacker, on an international scale, and everyone listened to him.) Tj
T* (   Obsessive, creative and quick off the mark, Electron had respect,) Tj
T* (   which is one reason Par felt so badly.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Theorem told Electron the bad news in a private conversation) Tj
T* (   on-line, Electron had let fly in the public area, ripping into the) Tj
T* (   American hacker on the main chat section of Altos, in front of) Tj
T* (   everyone.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par took it on the chin and refused to fight back. What else could he) Tj
T* (   do? He knew what it was like to hurt. He felt for the guy and knew how) Tj
T* (   he would feel if he lost Theorem. And he knew that Electron must be) Tj
T* (   suffering a terrible loss of face. Everyone saw Electron and Theorem) Tj
T* (   as an item. They had been together for more than a year. So Par met) Tj
T* (   Electron's fury with grace and quiet words of consolation.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par didn't hear much from Electron after that day. The Australian) Tj
T* (   still visited Altos, but he seemed more withdrawn, at least whenever) Tj
T* (   Par was around. After that day, Par ran into him once, on a phone) Tj
T* (   bridge with a bunch of Australian hackers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix said on the bridge, `Hey, Electron. Par's on the bridge.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron paused. `Oh, really,' he answered coolly. Then he went) Tj
T* (   silent.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par let Electron keep his distance. After all, Par had what really) Tj

T* (   to expect too much, but he found it difficult to stop savouring the) Tj
T* (   thought of finally seeing Theorem face to face. It gave him) Tj
T* (   butterflies.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Yeah, Par thought, things are really looking up.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The beauty of Altos was that, like Pacific Island or any other local) Tj
T* (   BBS, a hacker could take on any identity he wanted. And he could do it) Tj
T* (   on an international scale. Visiting Altos was like attending a) Tj
T* (   glittering masquerade ball. Anyone could recreate himself. A socially) Tj
T* (   inept hacker could pose as a character of romance and adventure. And a) Tj
T* (   security official could pose as a hacker.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Which is exactly what Telenet security officer Steve Mathews did on 27) Tj
T* (   October 1988. Par happened to be on-line, chatting away with his) Tj
T* (   friends and hacker colleagues. At any given moment, there were always) Tj
T* (   a few strays on Altos, a few people who weren't regulars. Naturally,) Tj
T* (   Mathews didn't announce himself as being a Telenet guy. He just) Tj
T* (   slipped quietly onto Altos looking like any other hacker. He might) Tj
T* (   engage a hacker in conversation, but he let the hacker do most of the) Tj
T* (   talking. He was there to listen.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   On that fateful day, Par happened to be in one of his magnanimous) Tj
T* (   moods. Par had never had much money growing up, but he was always very) Tj
T* (   generous with what he did have. He talked for a little while with the) Tj
T* (   unknown hacker on Altos, and then gave him one of the debit cards) Tj
T* (   taken from his visits to the CitiSaudi computer. Why not? On Altos, it) Tj
T* (   was a bit like handing out your business card. `The) Tj
T* (   Parmaster--Parameters Par Excellence'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par had got his full name--The Parmaster--in his earliest hacking) Tj
T* (   days. Back then, he belonged to a group of teenagers involved in) Tj
T* (   breaking the copy protections on software programs for Apple IIes,) Tj
T* (   particularly games. Par had a special gift for working out the copy) Tj
T* (   protection parameters, which was a first step in bypassing the) Tj
T* (   manufacturers' protection schemes. The ringleader of the group began) Tj
T* (   calling him `the master of parameters'--The Parmaster--Par, for short.) Tj
T* (   As he moved into serious hacking and developed his expertise in X.25) Tj
T* (   networks, he kept the name because it fitted nicely in his new) Tj
T* (   environment. `Par?' was a common command on an X.25 pad, the modem) Tj
T* (   gateway to an X.25 network.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I've got lots more where that come from,' Par told the stranger on) Tj
T* (   Altos. `I've got like 4000 cards from a Citibank system.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Not long after that, Steve Mathews was monitoring Altos again, when) Tj
T* (   Par showed up handing out cards to people once more.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I've got an inside contact,' Par confided. `He's gonna make up a) Tj
T* (   whole mess of new, plastic cards with all these valid numbers from the) Tj
T* (   Citibank machine. Only the really big accounts, though. Nothing with a) Tj
T* (   balance under $25000.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Was Par just making idle conversation, talking big on Altos? Or would) Tj
T* (   he really have gone through with committing such a major fraud?) Tj
T* (   Citibank, Telenet and the US Secret Service would never know, because) Tj

T* (   Mathews contacted Larry Wallace, fraud investigator with Citibank in) Tj

T* (   all right. They belonged to the Saudi-American Bank in Saudi Arabia) Tj
T* (   and were held on a Citibank database in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.) Tj
T* (   Wallace determined that, with its affiliation to the Middle Eastern) Tj

T* (   ) Tj

T* (   Australian hackers and other assorted American phreakers and hackers) Tj
T* (   visited the bridge frequently. At any one moment, there might be eight) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Which wasn't quite true. His room-mate, Scott, had indeed disconnected) Tj
T* (   the phone which was in his name because he had been getting prank) Tj
T* (   calls. However, Scott opened a new telephone account at the same) Tj
T* (   address with the same name on the same day--all of which made the job) Tj
T* (   of tracking down the mysterious hacker named Par much easier for the) Tj
T* (   law enforcement agencies.) Tj

T* (   supervisor for the Southeastern Region of MCI Investigations, in) Tj

T* (   the row of phones. The smiling face suddenly dropped in a spasm of) Tj
T* (   shock. His skin turned ash white as the blood fled south. His deep-set) Tj
T* (   chocolate brown eyes, with their long, graceful lashes curving upward) Tj
T* (   and their soft, shy expression, seemed impossibly large.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   For at that moment Tammi told Par that his house had been raided by) Tj
T* (   the Secret Service. That Scott and Ed had been pretty upset about) Tj
T* (   having guns shoved in their faces, and had made statements about him) Tj
T* (   to the police. That they thought their phone was tapped. That the) Tj
T* (   Secret Service guys were still hunting for Par, they knew his real) Tj
T* (   name, and she thought there was an all points bulletin out for him.) Tj
T* (   Scott had told the Secret Service about Par's red bag, the one with) Tj
T* (   all his hacking notes that he always carried around. The one with the) Tj
T* (   print-out of all the Citibank credit card numbers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   And so it was that Par came to gaze down at his bag with a look of) Tj
T* (   alarm. He realised instantly that the Secret Service would be looking) Tj
T* (   for that red bag. If they didn't know what he looked like, they would) Tj
T* (   simply watch for the bag.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   That bag was not something Par could hide easily. The Citibank) Tj
T* (   print-out was the size of a phone book. He also had dozens of disks) Tj
T* (   loaded with the cards and other sensitive hacking information.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par had used the cards to make a few free calls, but he hadn't been) Tj
T* (   charging up any jet skis. He fought temptation valiantly, and in the) Tj
T* (   end he had won, but others might not have been so victorious in the) Tj
T* (   same battle. Par figured that some less scrupulous hackers had) Tj
T* (   probably been charging up a storm. He was right. Someone had, for) Tj
T* (   example, tried to send a $367 bouquet of flowers to a woman in El Paso) Tj
T* (   using one of the stolen cards. The carder had unwittingly chosen a) Tj
T* (   debit card belonging to a senior Saudi bank executive who happened to) Tj
T* (   be in his office at the time the flower order was placed. Citibank) Tj
T* (   investigator Larry Wallace added notes on that incident to his growing) Tj
T* (   file.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par figured that Citibank would probably try to pin every single) Tj
T* (   attempt at carding on him. Why not? What kind of credibility would a) Tj
T* (   seventeen-year-old hacker have in denying those sorts of allegations?) Tj
T* (   Zero. Par made a snap decision. He sidled up to a trash bin in a dark) Tj
T* (   corner. Scanning the scene warily, Par casually reached into the red) Tj
T* (   bag, pulled out the thick wad of Citibank card print-outs and stuffed) Tj
T* (   it into the bin. He fluffed a few stray pieces of garbage over the) Tj
T* (   top.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He worried about the computer disks with all his other valuable) Tj
T* (   hacking information. They represented thousands of hours of work and) Tj
T* (   he couldn't bring himself to throw it all away. The 10 megabyte) Tj
T* (   trophy. More than 4000 cards. 130000 different transactions. In the) Tj
T* (   end, he decided to hold on to the disks, regardless of the risk. At) Tj
T* (   least, without the print-out, he could crumple the bag up a bit and) Tj
T* (   make it a little less conspicuous. As Par slowly moved away from the) Tj
T* (   bin, he glanced back to check how nondescript the burial site appeared) Tj
T* (   from a distance. It looked like a pile of garbage. Trash worth) Tj
T* (   millions of dollars, headed for the dump.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As he boarded the bus to Salinas with his mother, Par's mind was) Tj
T* (   instantly flooded with images of a homeless person fishing the) Tj
T* (   print-out from the bin and asking someone about it. He tried to push) Tj
T* (   the idea from his head.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   During the bus ride, Par attempted to figure out what he was going to) Tj
T* (   do. He didn't tell his mother anything. She couldn't even begin to) Tj
T* (   comprehend his world of computers and networks, let alone his current) Tj
T* (   predicament. Further, Par and his mother had suffered from a somewhat) Tj
T* (   strained relationship since he ran away from home not long after his) Tj
T* (   seventeenth birthday. He had been kicked out of school for) Tj
T* (   non-attendance, but had found a job tutoring students in computers at) Tj
T* (   the local college. Before the trip to Chicago, he had seen her just) Tj
T* (   once in six months. No, he couldn't turn to her for help.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The bus rolled toward the Salinas station. En route, it travelled down) Tj
T* (   the street where Par lived. He saw a jogger, a thin black man wearing) Tj
T* (   a walkman. What the hell is a jogger doing here, Par thought. No-one) Tj
T* (   jogged in the semi-industrial neighbourhood. Par's house was about the) Tj
T* (   only residence amid all the light-industrial buildings. As soon as the) Tj
T* (   jogger was out of sight of the house, he suddenly broke away from his) Tj
T* (   path, turned off to one side and hit the ground. As he lay on his) Tj
T* (   stomach on some grass, facing the house, he seemed to begin talking) Tj
T* (   into the walkman.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Sitting watching this on the bus, Par flipped out. They were out to) Tj
T* (   get him, no doubt about it. When the bus finally arrived at the depot) Tj
T* (   and his mother began sorting out their luggage, Par tucked the red bag) Tj
T* (   under his arm and disappeared. He found a pay phone and called Scott) Tj
T* (   to find out the status of things. Scott handed the phone to Chris,) Tj
T* (   another friend who lived in the house. Chris had been away at his) Tj
T* (   parents' home during the Thanksgiving raid.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Hold tight and lay low,' Chris told Par.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I'm on my way over to pick you up and take you to a lawyer's office) Tj
T* (   where you can get some sort of protection.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A specialist in criminal law, Richard Rosen was born in New York but) Tj
T* (   raised in his later childhood in California. He had a personality) Tj
T* (   which reflected the steely stubbornness of a New Yorker, tempered with) Tj
T* (   the laid-back friendliness of the west coast. Rosen also harboured a) Tj
T* (   strong anti-authoritarian streak. He represented the local chapter of) Tj
T* (   Hell's Angels in the middle-class County of Monterey. He also caused a) Tj
T* (   splash representing the growing midwifery movement, which promoted) Tj
T* (   home-births. The doctors of California didn't like him much as a) Tj
T* (   result.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par's room-mates met with Rosen after the raid to set things up for) Tj
T* (   Par's return. They told him about the terrifying ordeal of the Secret) Tj
T* (   Service raid, and how they were interrogated for an hour and a half) Tj
T* (   before being pressured to give statements. Scott, in particular, felt) Tj
T* (   that he had been forced to give a statement against Par under duress.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   While Par talked to Chris on the phone, he noticed a man standing at) Tj
T* (   the end of the row of pay phones. This man was also wearing a walkman.) Tj
T* (   He didn't look Par in the eye. Instead, he faced the wall, glancing) Tj
T* (   furtively off to the side toward where Par was standing. Who was that) Tj
T* (   guy? Fear welled up inside Par and all sorts of doubts flooded his) Tj
T* (   mind. Who could he trust?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Scott hadn't told him about the raid. Were his room-mates in cahoots) Tj
T* (   the Secret Service? Were they just buying time so they could turn him) Tj
T* (   in? There was no-one else Par could turn to. His mother wouldn't) Tj

T* (   understand. Besides, she had problems of her own. And he didn't have a) Tj
T* (   father. As far as Par was concerned, his father was as good as dead.) Tj
T* (   He had never met the man, but he heard he was a prison officer in) Tj
T* (   Florida. Not a likely candidate for helping Par in this situation. He) Tj
T* (   was close to his grandparents--they had bought his computer for him as) Tj
T* (   a present--but they lived in a tiny Mid-Western town and they simply) Tj
T* (   wouldn't understand either.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par didn't know what to do, but he didn't seem to have many options at) Tj
T* (   the moment, so he told Chris he would wait at the station for him.) Tj
T* (   Then he ducked around a corner and tried to hide.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A few minutes later, Chris pulled into the depot. Par dove into the) Tj
T* (   Toyota Landcruiser and Chris tore out of the station toward Rosen's) Tj
T* (   office. They noticed a white car race out of the bus station after) Tj
T* (   them.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   While they drove, Par pieced together the story from Chris. No-one had) Tj
T* (   warned him about the raid because everyone in the house believed the) Tj
T* (   phone line was tapped. Telling Par while he was in Chicago might have) Tj
T* (   meant another visit from the Secret Service. All they had been able to) Tj
T* (   do was line up Rosen to help him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par checked the rear-view mirror. The white car was still following) Tj
T* (   them. Chris made a hard turn at the next intersection and accelerated) Tj
T* (   down the California speedway. The white car tore around the corner in) Tj
T* (   pursuit. No matter what Chris did, he couldn't shake the tail. Par sat) Tj
T* (   in the seat next to Chris, quietly freaking out.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Just 24 hours before, he had been safe and sound in Chicago. How did) Tj
T* (   he end up back here in California being chased by a mysterious driver) Tj
T* (   in a white car?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Chris tried his best to break free, swerving and racing. The white car) Tj
T* (   wouldn't budge. But Chris and Par had one advantage over the white) Tj
T* (   car; they were in a four-wheel drive. In a split-second decision,) Tj
T* (   Chris jerked the steering wheel to one side. The Landcruiser veered) Tj
T* (   off the road onto a lettuce field. Par gripped the inside of the door) Tj
T* (   as the 4WD bounced through the dirt over the neat crop rows. Near-ripe) Tj
T* (   heads of lettuce went flying out from under the tires. Half-shredded) Tj
T* (   lettuce leaves filled the air. A cloud of dirt enveloped the car. The) Tj
T* (   vehicle skidded and jerked, but finally made its way to a highway at) Tj
T* (   the far end of the field. Chris hit the highway running, swerving into) Tj
T* (   the lane at high speed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Par looked back, the white car had disappeared. Chris kept his) Tj
T* (   foot on the accelerator and Par barely breathed until the Landcruiser) Tj
T* (   pulled up in front of Richard Rosen's building.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par leaped out, the red bag still clutched tightly under his arm, and) Tj
T* (   high-tailed it into the lawyer's office. The receptionist looked a bit) Tj
T* (   shocked when he said his name. Someone must have filled her in on the) Tj
T* (   details.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Rosen quickly ushered him into his office. Introductions were brief) Tj
T* (   and Par cut to the story of the chase. Rosen listened intently,) Tj
T* (   occasionally asking a well-pointed question, and then took control of) Tj
T* (   the situation.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The first thing they needed to do was call off the Secret Service) Tj

T* (   chase, Rosen said, so Par didn't have to spend any more time ducking) Tj
T* (   around corners and hiding in bus depots. He called the Secret) Tj
T* (   Service's San Francisco office and asked Special Agent Thomas J.) Tj
T* (   Holman to kill the Secret Service pursuit in exchange for an agreement) Tj
T* (   that Par would turn himself in to be formally charged.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Holman insisted that they had to talk to Par.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   No, Rosen said. There would be no interviews for Par by law) Tj
T* (   enforcement agents until a deal had been worked out.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But the Secret Service needed to talk to Par, Holman insisted. They) Tj
T* (   could only discuss all the other matters after the Secret Service had) Tj
T* (   had a chance to talk with Par.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Rosen politely warned Holman not to attempt to contact his client. You) Tj
T* (   have something to say to Par, you go through me, he said. Holman did) Tj
T* (   not like that at all. When the Secret Service wanted to talk to) Tj
T* (   someone, they were used to getting their way. He pushed Rosen, but the) Tj
T* (   answer was still no. No no no and no again. Holman had made a mistake.) Tj
T* (   He had assumed that everyone wanted to do business with the United) Tj
T* (   States Secret Service.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When he finally realised Rosen wouldn't budge, Holman gave up. Rosen) Tj
T* (   then negotiated with the federal prosecutor, US Attorney Joe Burton,) Tj
T* (   who was effectively Holman's boss in the case, to call off the pursuit) Tj
T* (   in exchange for Par handing himself in to be formally charged.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then Par gave Rosen his red bag, for safekeeping.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   At about the same time, Citibank investigator Wallace and Detective) Tj
T* (   Porter of the Salinas Police interviewed Par's mother as she returned) Tj
T* (   home from the bus depot. She said that her son had moved out of her) Tj
T* (   home some six months before, leaving her with a $2000 phone bill she) Tj
T* (   couldn't pay. They asked if they could search her home. Privately, she) Tj
T* (   worried about what would happen if she refused. Would they tell the) Tj
T* (   office where she worked as a clerk? Could they get her fired? A simple) Tj
T* (   woman who had little experience dealing with law enforcement agents,) Tj
T* (   Par's mother agreed. The investigators took Par's disks and papers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par turned himself in to the Salinas Police in the early afternoon of) Tj
T* (   12 December. The police photographed and fingerprinted him before) Tj
T* (   handing him a citation--a small yellow slip headed `502 \(c\) \(1\) PC'.) Tj
T* (   It looked like a traffic ticket, but the two charges Par faced were) Tj
T* (   felonies, and each carried a maximum term of three years for a minor.) Tj
T* (   Count 1, for hacking into Citicorp Credit Services, also carried a) Tj
T* (   fine of up to $10000. Count 2, for `defrauding a telephone service',) Tj
T* (   had no fine: the charges were for a continuing course of conduct,) Tj
T* (   meaning that they applied to the same activity over an extended period) Tj
T* (   of time.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Federal investigators had been astonished to find Par was so young.) Tj
T* (   Dealing with a minor in the federal court system was a big hassle, so) Tj
T* (   the prosecutor decided to ask the state authorities to prosecute the) Tj
T* (   case. Par was ordered to appear in Monterey County Juvenile Court on) Tj
T* (   10 July 1989.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Over the next few months, Par worked closely with Rosen. Though Rosen) Tj
T* (   was a very adept lawyer, the situation looked pretty depressing.) Tj
T* (   Citibank claimed it had spent $30000 on securing its systems and Par) Tj

T* (   believed that the corporation might be looking for up to $3 million in) Tj
T* (   total damages. While they couldn't prove Par had made any money from) Tj
T* (   the cards himself, the prosecution would argue that his generous) Tj
T* (   distribution of them had led to serious financial losses. And that was) Tj
T* (   just the financial institutions.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Much more worrying was what might come out about Par's visits to TRW's) Tj
T* (   computers. The Secret Service had seized at least one disk with TRW) Tj
T* (   material on it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   TRW was a large, diverse company, with assets of $2.1 billion and) Tj
T* (   sales of almost $7 billion in 1989, nearly half of which came from the) Tj
T* (   US government. It employed more than 73000 people, many of who worked) Tj
T* (   with the company's credit ratings business. TRW's vast databases held) Tj
T* (   private details of millions of people--addresses, phone numbers,) Tj
T* (   financial data.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   That, however, was just one of the company's many businesses. TRW also) Tj
T* (   did defence work--very secret defence work. Its Space and Defense) Tj
T* (   division, based in Redondo Beach, California, was widely believed to) Tj
T* (   be a major beneficiary of the Reagan Government's Star Wars budget.) Tj
T* (   More than 10 per cent of the company's employees worked in this) Tj
T* (   division, designing spacecraft systems, communications systems,) Tj
T* (   satellites and other, unspecified, space `instruments'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The siezed disk had some mail from the company's TRWMAIL systems. It) Tj
T* (   wasn't particularly sensitive, mostly just company propaganda sent to) Tj
T* (   employees, but the Secret Service might think that where there was) Tj
T* (   smoke, there was bound to be fire. TRW did the kind of work that makes) Tj
T* (   governments very nervous when it comes to unauthorised access. And Par) Tj
T* (   had visited certain TRW machines; he knew that company had a missiles) Tj
T* (   research section, and even a space weapons section.) Tj

T* (   With so many people out to get him--Citibank, the Secret Service, the) Tj
T* (   local police, even his own mother had helped the other side--it was) Tj
T* (   only a matter of time before they unearthed the really secret things) Tj
T* (   he had seen while hacking. Par began to wonder if was such a good idea) Tj
T* (   for him to stay around for the trial.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* () Tj
T* (   In early 1989, when Theorem stepped off the plane which carried her) Tj
T* (   from Switzerland to San Francisco, she was pleased that she had) Tj
T* (   managed to keep a promise to herself. It wasn't always an easy) Tj
T* (   promise. There were times of intimacy, of perfect connection, between) Tj
T* (   the two voices on opposite sides of the globe, when it seemed so) Tj
T* (   breakable.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Meanwhile, Par braced himself. Theorem had described herself in such) Tj
T* (   disparaging terms. He had even heard from others on Altos that she was) Tj
T* (   homely. But that description had ultimately come from her anyway, so) Tj
T* (   it didn't really count.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Finally, as he watched the stream of passengers snake out to the) Tj
T* (   waiting area, he told himself it didn't matter anyway. After all, he) Tj
T* (   had fallen in love with her--her being, her essence--not her image as) Tj
T* (   it appeared in flesh. And he had told her so. She had said the same) Tj
T* (   back to him.) Tj

T* (   She was quite pretty, with straight, brown shoulder-length hair and) Tj

T* (   he had expected, when it happened.) Tj

T* (   Theorem smiled.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par almost lost his balance. It was a devastating smile, big and) Tj
T* (   toothy, warm and genuine. Her whole face lit up with a fire of) Tj
T* (   animation. That smile sealed it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   She had kept her promise to herself. There was no clear image of Par) Tj

T* (   from Altos at a party in Munich the year before, she had tried not to) Tj
T* (   create images of people based on their on-line personalities. That way) Tj
T* (   she would never suffer disappointment.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par and Theorem picked up her bags and got into Brian's car. Brian, a) Tj
T* (   friend who offered to play airport taxi because Par didn't have a car,) Tj
T* (   thought Theorem was pretty cool. A six-foot-tall French-speaking Swiss) Tj
T* (   woman. It was definitely cool. They drove back to Par's house. Then) Tj
T* (   Brian came in for a chat.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Brian asked Theorem all sorts of questions. He was really curious,) Tj
T* (   because he had never met anyone from Europe before. Par kept trying to) Tj
T* (   encourage his friend to leave but Brian wanted to know all about life) Tj
T* (   in Switzerland. What was the weather like? Did people ski all the) Tj
T* (   time?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par kept looking Brian in the eye and then staring hard at the door.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Did most Swiss speak English? What other languages did she know? A lot) Tj
T* (   of people skied in California. It was so cool talking to someone from) Tj
T* (   halfway around the world.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par did the silent chin-nudge toward the door and, at last, Brian got) Tj
T* (   the hint. Par ushered his friend out of the house. Brian was only) Tj
T* (   there for about ten minutes, but it felt like a year. When Par and) Tj
T* (   Theorem were alone, they talked a bit, then Par suggested they go for) Tj
T* (   a walk.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Halfway down the block, Par tentatively reached for her hand and took) Tj
T* (   it in his own. She seemed to like it. Her hand was warm. They talked a) Tj
T* (   bit more, then Par stopped. He turned to face her. He paused, and then) Tj
T* (   told her something he had told her before over the telephone,) Tj
T* (   something they both knew already.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Theorem kissed him. It startled Par. He was completely unprepared.) Tj
T* (   Then Theorem said the same words back to him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When they returned to the house, things progressed from there. They) Tj
T* (   spent two and a half weeks in each other's arms--and they were) Tj
T* (   glorious, sun-drenched weeks. The relationship proved to be far, far) Tj
T* (   better in person than it had ever been on-line or on the telephone.) Tj
T* (   Theorem had captivated Par, and Par, in turn, created a state of bliss) Tj
T* (   in Theorem.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par showed her around his little world in northern California. They) Tj
T* (   visited a few tourist sites, but mostly they just spent a lot of time) Tj

T* (   scanning. Par didn't say much else about it because the discovery) Tj
T* (   scared the hell out of him.) Tj

T* (   Suddenly, he felt like the man who knew too much. He'd been in and out) Tj

T* (   laptop before arriving in North Carolina.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After a few weeks at the motel, however, he couldn't shake the feeling) Tj
T* (   that he was being watched. There were too many strangers coming and) Tj
T* (   going. He wondered if the hotel guests waiting in their cars were) Tj
T* (   spying on him, and he soon began jumping at shadows. Perhaps, he) Tj
T* (   thought, the Secret Service had found him after all.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par thought about how he could investigate the matter in more depth.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   One of The Atlanta Three hackers, The Prophet, called Nibbler) Tj
T* (   occasionally to exchange hacking information, particularly security) Tj
T* (   bugs in Unix systems. During one of their talks, Prophet told Par) Tj
T* (   about a new security flaw he'd been experimenting with on a network) Tj
T* (   that belonged to the phone company.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The Atlanta Three, a Georgia-based wing of The Legion of Doom, spent a) Tj
T* (   good deal of time weaving their way through BellSouth, the phone) Tj
T* (   company covering the south-eastern US. They knew about phone switching) Tj
T* (   stations the way Par knew about Tymnet. The Secret Service had raided) Tj
T* (   the hackers in July 1989 but had not arrested them yet, so in) Tj
T* (   September The Prophet continued to maintain an interest in his) Tj
T* (   favourite target.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par thought the flaw in BellSouth's network sounded very cool and) Tj
T* (   began playing around in the company's systems. Dial up the company's) Tj
T* (   computer network, poke around, look at things. The usual stuff.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It occurred to Par that he could check out the phone company's records) Tj
T* (   of the motel to see if there was anything unusual going on. He typed) Tj
T* (   in the motel's main phone number and the system fed back the motel's) Tj
T* (   address, name and some detailed technical information, such as the) Tj
T* (   exact cable and pair attached to the phone number. Then he looked up) Tj
T* (   the phone line of the computer chalet. Things looked odd on that line.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The line which he and Nibbler used for most of their hacking showed a) Tj
T* (   special status: `maintenance unit on line'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   What maintenance unit? Nibbler hadn't mentioned any problems with any) Tj
T* (   of the motel's lines, but Par checked with him. No problems with the) Tj
T* (   telephones.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par felt nervous. In addition to messing around with the phone) Tj
T* (   company's networks, he had been hacking into a Russian computer) Tj
T* (   network from the computer chalet. The Soviet network was a shiny new) Tj
T* (   toy. It had only been connected to the rest of the world's global) Tj
T* (   packet-switched network for about a month, which made it particularly) Tj
T* (   attractive virgin territory.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Nibbler called in a friend to check the motel's phones. The friend, a) Tj
T* (   former telephone company technician turned freelancer, came over to) Tj
T* (   look at the equipment. He told Nibbler and Par that something weird) Tj
T* (   was happening in the motel's phone system. The line voltages were way) Tj
T* (   off.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par realised instantly what was going on. The system was being) Tj
T* (   monitored. Every line coming in and going out was probably being) Tj
T* (   tapped, which meant only one thing. Someone--the phone company, the) Tj
T* (   local police, the FBI or the Secret Service--was onto him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Nibbler and Par quickly packed up all Nibbler's computer gear, along) Tj
T* (   with Par's hacking notes, and moved to another motel across town. They) Tj
T* (   had to shut down all their hacking activities and cover their tracks.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par had left programs running which sniffed people's passwords and) Tj

T* (   Par couldn't afford to move on just yet. Besides, maybe only the) Tj
T* (   telephone company had taken an interest in the motel's phone system.) Tj
T* (   Par had done a lot of poking and prodding of the telecommunications) Tj
T* (   companies' computer systems from the motel phone, but he had done it) Tj
T* (   anonymously. Perhaps BellSouth felt a little curious and just wanted) Tj

T* (   enforcement agencies probably didn't know that Par, the fugitive, was) Tj
T* (   hiding in the motel.) Tj

T* (   more watchful of the people coming and going. He glanced out the front) Tj

T* (   the footsteps coming and going. How many of the guests were really) Tj
T* (   just tourists? Par went through the guest list and found a man) Tj
T* (   registered as being from New Jersey. He was from one of the AT&T) Tj
T* (   corporations left after the break-up of Bell Systems. Why on earth) Tj
T* (   would an AT&T guy be staying in a tiny hick town in North Carolina?) Tj
T* (   Maybe a few Secret Service agents had snuck into the motel and were) Tj
T* (   watching the chalet.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par needed to bring the paranoia under control. He needed some fresh) Tj
T* (   air, so he went out for a walk. The weather was bad and the wind blew) Tj
T* (   hard, whipping up small tornadoes of autumn leaves. Soon it began) Tj
T* (   raining and Par sought cover in the pay phone across the street.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Despite having been on the run for a few months, Par still called) Tj
T* (   Theorem almost every day, mostly by phreaking calls through bulk) Tj
T* (   telecommunications companies. He dialled her number and they talked) Tj
T* (   for a bit. He told her about how the voltage was way off on the) Tj
T* (   motel's PABX and how the phone might be tapped. She asked how he was) Tj
T* (   holding up. Then they spoke softly about when they might see each) Tj
T* (   other again.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Outside the phone box, the storm worsened. The rain hammered the roof) Tj
T* (   from one side and then another as the wind jammed it in at strange) Tj
T* (   angles. The darkened street was deserted. Tree branches creaked under) Tj
T* (   the strain of the wind. Rivulets rushed down the leeward side of the) Tj
T* (   booth and formed a wall of water outside the glass. Then a trash bin) Tj
T* (   toppled over and its contents flew onto the road.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Trying to ignore to the havoc around him, Par curled the phone handset) Tj
T* (   into a small protected space, cupped between his hand, his chest and a) Tj
T* (   corner of the phone booth. He reminded Theorem of their time together) Tj
T* (   in California, of two and a half weeks, and they laughed gently over) Tj
T* (   intimate secrets.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A tree branch groaned and then broke under the force of the wind. When) Tj
T* (   it crashed on the pavement near the phone booth, Theorem asked Par) Tj

T* (   When Par opened the booth door, he was deluged by water. He dashed) Tj

T* (   the storm, and he dreamed of Theorem.) Tj

T* (   Hurricane Hugo lasted more than three days, but they felt like the) Tj

T* (   Secret Service wouldn't be conducting any raids during a hurricane.) Tj
T* (   South Carolina took the brunt of Hugo but North Carolina also suffered) Tj

T* (   hive of activity in the car park. There were cars. There was a van.) Tj
T* (   There was a collection of spectators.) Tj

T* (   from the motel, a maintenance worker named John, who looked vaguely) Tj
T* (   like Par. They seemed to be hauling John over the coals, searching his) Tj
T* (   wallet for identification and quizzing him. Then they escorted him to) Tj
T* (   the van, presumably to run his prints.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par's mind began moving again. He tried to think clearly. What was the) Tj
T* (   best way out? He had to get back into his room. It would give him some) Tj
T* (   cover while he figured out what to do next. The photos of Theorem) Tj
T* (   flashed through his mind. No way was he going to let the Secret) Tj
T* (   Service get hold of those. He needed to stash them and fast.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He could see the Secret Service agents searching the computer chalet.) Tj
T* (   Thank God he and Nibbler had moved all the equipment. At least there) Tj
T* (   was nothing incriminating in there and they wouldn't be able to seize) Tj
T* (   all their gear.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par breathed deeply, deliberately, and forced himself to back away) Tj
T* (   from the railing toward the door to his room. He resisted the urge to) Tj
T* (   dash into his room, to recoil from the scene being played out below) Tj
T* (   him. Abrupt movements would draw the agents' attention.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Just as Par began to move, one of the agents turned around. He scanned) Tj
T* (   the two-storey motel complex and his gaze quickly came to rest on Par.) Tj

T* (   While these thoughts raced through Par's mind, he stood rigid, his) Tj
T* (   feet glued to the cement floor, his face locked into the probing gaze) Tj
T* (   of the Secret Service agent. He felt like they were the only two) Tj
T* (   people who existed in the universe.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then, inexplicably, the agent looked away. He swivelled around to) Tj
T* (   finish his conversation with another agent. It was as if he had never) Tj
T* (   even seen the fugitive.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par stood, suspended and unbelieving. Somehow it seemed impossible. He) Tj
T* (   began to edge the rest of the way to his motel room. Slowly, casually,) Tj
T* (   he slid inside and shut the door behind him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   His mind raced back to the photos of Theorem and he searched the room) Tj
T* (   for a safe hiding place. There wasn't one. The best option was) Tj
T* (   something above eye-level. He pulled a chair across the room, climbed) Tj
T* (   on it and pressed on the ceiling. The rectangular panel of) Tj
T* (   plasterboard lifted easily and Par slipped the photos in the space,) Tj
T* (   then replaced the panel. If the agents tore the room apart, they would) Tj
T* (   likely find the pictures. But the photos would probably escape a quick) Tj
T* (   search, which was the best he could hope for at this stage.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Next, he turned his mind to escaping. The locals were pretty cool) Tj
T* (   about everything, and Par thought he could count on the staff not to) Tj
T* (   mention his presence to the Secret Service. That bought him some time,) Tj
T* (   but he couldn't get out of the room without being seen. Besides, if he) Tj
T* (   was spotted walking off the property, he would certainly be stopped) Tj
T* (   and questioned.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Even if he did manage to get out of the motel grounds, it wouldn't) Tj
T* (   help much. The town wasn't big enough to shield him from a thorough) Tj
T* (   search and there was no-one there he trusted enough to hide him. It) Tj
T* (   might look a little suspicious, this young man running away from the) Tj
T* (   motel on foot in a part of the world where everyone travelled by car.) Tj
T* (   Hitchhiking was out of the question. With his luck, he'd probably get) Tj
T* (   picked up by one of the agents leaving the raid. No, he wanted a more) Tj
T* (   viable plan. What he really needed was to get out of the area) Tj
T* (   altogether, to flee the state.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par knew that John travelled to Asheville to attend classes and that) Tj
T* (   he left very early. If the authorities had been watching the motel for) Tj
T* (   a while, they would know that his 5 a.m. departure was normal. And) Tj
T* (   there was one other thing about the early departure which seemed) Tj
T* (   promising. It was still dark at that hour.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   If Par could get as far as Asheville, he might be able to get a lift) Tj
T* (   to Charlotte, and from there he could fly somewhere far away.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par considered the options again and again. Hiding out in the motel) Tj
T* (   room seemed the most sensible thing to do. He had been moving rooms) Tj
T* (   around the motel pretty regularly, so he might have appeared to be) Tj
T* (   just another traveller to anyone watching the motel. With any luck the) Tj
T* (   Secret Service would be concentrating their search on the chalet,) Tj
T* (   ripping the place apart in a vain hunt for the computer equipment. As) Tj
T* (   these thoughts went through his head, the phone rang, making Par jump.) Tj
T* (   He stared at it, wondering whether to answer.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He picked it up.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `It's Nibbler,' a voice whispered.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yeah,' Par whispered back.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Par, the Secret Service is here, searching the motel.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I know. I saw them.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `They've already searched the room next to yours.' Par nearly died.) Tj
T* (   The agents had been less than two metres from where he was standing) Tj
T* (   and he hadn't even known it. That room was where John stayed. It was) Tj
T* (   connected to his by an inner door, but both sides were locked.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Move into John's room and lay low. Gotta go.' Nibbler hung up) Tj
T* (   abruptly.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par put his ear to the wall and listened. Nothing. He unlocked the) Tj
T* (   connecting inner door, turned the knob and pressed lightly. It gave.) Tj
T* (   Someone had unlocked the other side after the search. Par squinted) Tj
T* (   through the crack in the door. The room was silent and still. He) Tj
T* (   opened it--no-one home. Scooping up his things, he quickly moved into) Tj
T* (   John's room.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then he waited. Pacing and fidgeting, he strained his ears to catch) Tj
T* (   the sounds outside. Every bang and creak of a door opening and closing) Tj
T* (   set him on edge. Late that night, after the law enforcement officials) Tj
T* (   had left, Nibbler called him on the house phone and told him what had) Tj
T* (   happened.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Nibbler had been inside the computer chalet when the Secret Service) Tj
T* (   showed up with a search warrant. The agents took names, numbers, every) Tj
T* (   detail they could, but they had trouble finding any evidence of) Tj
T* (   hacking. Finally, one of them emerged from the chalet triumphantly) Tj
T* (   waving a single computer disk in the air. The law enforcement) Tj
T* (   entourage hanging around in front of the chalet let out a little) Tj
T* (   cheer, but Nibbler could hardly keep a straight face. His younger) Tj
T* (   brother had been learning the basics of computer graphics with a) Tj
T* (   program called Logo. The United States Secret Service would soon be) Tj
T* (   uncovering the secret drawings of a primary school student.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par laughed. It helped relieve the stress. Then he told Nibbler his) Tj
T* (   escape plan, and Nibbler agreed to arrange matters. His parents didn't) Tj
T* (   know the whole story, but they liked Par and wanted to help him. Then) Tj
T* (   Nibbler wished his friend well.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par didn't even try to rest before his big escape. He was as highly) Tj
T* (   strung as a racehorse at the gate. What if the Secret Service was) Tj
T* (   still watching the place? There was no garage attached to the main) Tj
T* (   motel building which he could access from the inside. He would be) Tj
T* (   exposed, even though it would only be for a minute or so. The night) Tj
T* (   would provide reasonable cover, but the escape plan wasn't fool-proof.) Tj
T* (   If agents were keeping the motel under observation from a distance) Tj
T* (   they might miss him taking off from his room. On the other hand, there) Tj
T* (   could be undercover agents posing as guests watching the entire) Tj
T* (   complex from inside their room.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Paranoid thoughts stewed in Par's mind throughout the night. Just) Tj

T* (   before 5 a.m., he heard John's car pull up outside. Par flicked off) Tj
T* (   the light in his room, opened his door a crack and scanned the motel) Tj
T* (   grounds. All quiet, bar the single car, which puffed and grunted in) Tj
T* (   the still, cold air. The windows in most of the buildings were dark.) Tj
T* (   It was now or never.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par opened the door all the way and slipped down the hallway. As he) Tj
T* (   crept downstairs, the pre-dawn chill sent a shiver down his spine.) Tj
T* (   Glancing quickly from side to side, he hurried toward the waiting car,) Tj
T* (   pulled the back door open and dove onto the seat. Keeping his head) Tj
T* (   down, he twisted around, rolled onto the floor and closed the door) Tj
T* (   with little more than a soft click.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As the car began to move. Par reached for a blanket which had been) Tj
T* (   tossed on the floor and pulled it over himself. After a while, when) Tj
T* (   John told him they were safely out of the town, Par slipped the) Tj
T* (   blanket off his face and he looked up at the early morning sky. He) Tj
T* (   tried to get comfortable on the floor. It was going to be a long ride.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   At Asheville, John dropped Par off at an agreed location. Par thanked) Tj
T* (   him and hopped into a waiting car. Someone else from his extensive) Tj
T* (   network of friends and acquaintances took him to Charlotte.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   This time Par rode in the front passenger seat. For the first time, he) Tj
T* (   saw the true extent of the damage wreaked by Hurricane Hugo. The small) Tj
T* (   town where he had been staying had been slashed by rain and high) Tj
T* (   winds, but on the way to the Charlotte airport, where he would pick up) Tj
T* (   a flight to New York, Par watched the devastation with amazement. He) Tj
T* (   stared out the car window, unable to take his eyes off the storm's) Tj
T* (   trail of havoc.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The hurricane had swept up anything loose or fragile and turned it) Tj
T* (   into a missile on a suicide mission. Whatever mangled, broken) Tj
T* (   fragments remained after the turbulent winds had passed would have) Tj
T* (   been almost unrecognisable to those who had seen them before.) Tj

T* (   Theorem worried about Par as he staggered from corner to corner of the) Tj
T* (   continent. In fact, she had often asked him to consider giving himself) Tj
T* (   up. Moving from town to town was taking its toll on Par, and it wasn't) Tj
T* (   that much easier on Theorem. She hadn't thought going on the lam was) Tj
T* (   such a great idea in the first place, and she offered to pay for his) Tj
T* (   lawyer so he could stop running. Par declined. How could he hand) Tj
T* (   himself in when he believed elimination was a real possibility?) Tj
T* (   Theorem sent him money, since he had no way of earning a living and he) Tj
T* (   needed to eat. The worst parts, though, were the dark thoughts that) Tj
T* (   kept crossing her mind. Anything could happen to Par between phone) Tj
T* (   calls. Was he alive? In prison? Had he been raided, even accidentally) Tj
T* (   shot during a raid?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The Secret Service and the private security people seemed to want him) Tj
T* (   so badly. It was worrying, but hardly surprising. Par had embarrassed) Tj
T* (   them. He had broken into their machines and passed their private) Tj
T* (   information around in the underground. They had raided his home when) Tj
T* (   he wasn't even home. Then he had escaped a second raid, in North) Tj
T* (   Carolina, slipping between their fingers. He was constantly in their) Tj
T* (   face, continuing to hack blatantly and to show them contempt in things) Tj

T* (   all, he thought they knew what he had seen inside the TRW system. He) Tj
T* (   was a risk.) Tj

T* (   sleep properly, worrying about the knock on the door. Some mornings,) Tj
T* (   after a fitful few hours of rest, he woke with a start, unable to) Tj
T* (   remember where he was. Which house or motel, which friends, which) Tj
T* (   city.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He still hacked all the time, borrowing machines where he could. He) Tj
T* (   posted messages frequently on The Phoenix Project, an exclusive BBS) Tj
T* (   run by The Mentor and Erik Bloodaxe and frequented by LOD members and) Tj
T* (   the Australian hackers. Some well-known computer security people were) Tj
T* (   also invited onto certain, limited areas of the Texas-based board,) Tj
T* (   which immediately elevated the status of The Phoenix Project in the) Tj
T* (   computer underground. Hackers were as curious about the security) Tj
T* (   people as the security people were about their prey. The Phoenix) Tj
T* (   Project was special because it provided neutral ground, where both) Tj
T* (   sides could meet to exchange ideas.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Via the messages, Par continued to improve his hacking skills while) Tj
T* (   also talking with his friends, people like Erik Bloodaxe, from Texas,) Tj
T* (   and Phoenix, from The Realm in Melbourne. Electron also frequented The) Tj
T* (   Phoenix Project. These hackers knew Par was on the run, and sometimes) Tj
T* (   they joked with him about it. The humour made the stark reality of) Tj
T* (   Par's situation bearable. All the hackers on The Phoenix Project had) Tj
T* (   considered the prospect of being caught. But the presence of Par, and) Tj
T* (   his tortured existence on the run, hammered the implications home with) Tj
T* (   some regularity.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As Par's messages became depressed and paranoid, other hackers tried) Tj
T* (   to do what they could to help him. Elite US and foreign hackers who) Tj

T* (   Theorem was coming to visit him again.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Theorem arrived in New York in early 1991, the weather was) Tj
T* (   bitterly cold. They travelled to Connecticut, where Par was staying in) Tj
T* (   a share-house with friends.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par was nervous about a lot of things, but mostly about whether things) Tj
T* (   would be the same with Theorem. Within a few hours of her arrival, his) Tj
T* (   fears were assuaged. Theorem felt as passionately about him as she had) Tj
T* (   in California more than twelve months before. His own feelings were) Tj
T* (   even stronger. Theorem was a liferaft of happiness in the growing) Tj
T* (   turmoil of his life.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But things were different in the outside world. Life on the run with) Tj
T* (   Theorem was grim. Constantly dependent on other people, on their) Tj
T* (   charity, they were also subject to their petty whims.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A room-mate in the share-house got very drunk one night and picked a) Tj
T* (   fight with one of Par's friends. It was a major row and the friend) Tj
T* (   stormed out. In a fit of intoxicated fury, the drunk threatened to) Tj
T* (   turn Par in to the authorities. Slurring his angry words, he announced) Tj
T* (   he was going to call the FBI, CIA and Secret Service to tell them all) Tj
T* (   where Par was living.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par and Theorem didn't want to wait around to see if the drunk would) Tj
T* (   be true to his word. They grabbed their coats and fled into the) Tj
T* (   darkness. With little money, and no place else to stay, they walked) Tj
T* (   around for hours in the blistering, cold wind. Eventually they decided) Tj
T* (   they had no choice but to return to the house late at night, hopefully) Tj
T* (   after the drunk had fallen asleep.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   They sidled up to the front of the house, alert and on edge. It was) Tj
T* (   quite possible the drunk had called every law enforcement agency his) Tj
T* (   blurry mind could recall, in which case a collection of agents would) Tj
T* (   be lying in wait. The street was deadly quiet. All the parked cars) Tj
T* (   were deserted. Par peered in a darkened window but he couldn't see) Tj
T* (   anything. He motioned for Theorem to follow him into the house.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Though she couldn't see Par's face, Theorem could feel his tension.) Tj
T* (   Most of the time, she revelled in their closeness, a proximity which) Tj
T* (   at times seemed to border on telepathy. But at this moment, the) Tj
T* (   extraordinary gift of empathy felt like a curse. Theorem could feel) Tj
T* (   Par's all-consuming paranoia, and it filled her with terror as they) Tj
T* (   crept through the hall, checking each room. Finally they reached Par's) Tj
T* (   room, expecting to find two or three Secret Service agents waiting) Tj
T* (   patiently for them in the dark.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was empty.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   They climbed into bed and tried to get some sleep, but Theorem lay) Tj
T* (   awake in the dark for a little while, thinking about the strange and) Tj
T* (   fearful experience of returning to the house. Though she spoke to Par) Tj
T* (   on the phone almost every day when they were apart, she realised she) Tj
T* (   had missed something.) Tj

T* (   linked to the outside world, she couldn't logon to Altos. Although she) Tj
T* (   was never involved with hacking, Theorem had become quite addicted to) Tj
T* (   Altos. The loss of access to the Swiss X.25 network--and therefore to) Tj
T* (   Altos--left her feeling very depressed. She told Par over the) Tj
T* (   telephone, in sombre tones.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par decide to make a little present for Theorem. While most hackers) Tj
T* (   broke into computers hanging off the X.25 networks, Par broke into the) Tj
T* (   computers of the companies which ran the X.25 networks. Having control) Tj
T* (   over the machines owned by Telenet or Tymnet was real power. And as the) Tj
T* (   master of X.25 networks, Par could simply create a special account--just) Tj

T* (   best hackers, and they might even try to flirt with Theorem, but) Tj
T* (   she'll be thinking of me every time she logs on, he thought.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par called her on the telephone and gave her his special present. When) Tj

T* (   which Theorem had, and most people had to settle for using one of the) Tj
T* (   `guest' accounts. But it was much easier to hack Altos from a shell) Tj
T* (   account than from a `guest' account. Theorem's account would be the) Tj
T* (   targeted jump-off point.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   How did MOD get Theorem's Altos password? Most probably they were) Tj
T* (   watching one of the X.25 gateways she used as she passed through) Tj
T* (   Tymnet on her way to Altos. Maybe the MOD boys sniffed her password en) Tj
T* (   route. Or maybe they were watching the Tymnet security officials who) Tj
T* (   were watching that gateway.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In the end it didn't matter how MOD got Theorem's password on Altos.) Tj
T* (   What mattered was that they changed her password. When Theorem) Tj
T* (   couldn't get into Altos she was beside herself. She felt like a junkie) Tj
T* (   going cold turkey. It was too much. And of course she couldn't reach) Tj
T* (   Par. Because he was on the run, she had to wait for him to call her.) Tj
T* (   In fact she couldn't reach any of her other friends on Altos to ask) Tj
T* (   for help. How was she going to find them? They were all hackers. They) Tj
T* (   chose handles so no-one would know their real names.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   What Theorem didn't know was that, not only had she lost access to) Tj
T* (   Altos, but the MOD boys were using her account to hack the Altos) Tj

T* (   Theorem finally managed to get a third-hand message to Gandalf, a) Tj
T* (   well-known British hacker. She sought him out for two reasons. First,) Tj
T* (   he was a good friend and was therefore likely to help her out. Second,) Tj
T* (   Gandalf had root access on Altos, which meant he could give her a new) Tj
T* (   password or account.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Gandalf had established quite a reputation for himself in the computer) Tj
T* (   underground through the hacking group 8lgm--The Eight-Legged Groove) Tj
T* (   Machine, named after a British band. He and his friend, fellow British) Tj
T* (   hacker Pad, had the best four legs in the chorus line. They were a) Tj
T* (   world-class act, and certainly some of the best talent to come out of) Tj
T* (   the British hacking scene. But Gandalf and, to a lesser extent, Pad) Tj
T* (   had also developed a reputation for being arrogant. They rubbed some) Tj
T* (   of the American hackers the wrong way. Not that Pad and Gandalf seemed) Tj
T* (   to care. Their attitude was: We're good. We know it. Bugger off.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Gandalf disabled Theorem's account on Altos. He couldn't very well) Tj
T* (   just change the password and then send the new one through the) Tj
T* (   extended grapevine that Theorem had used to get a message through to) Tj
T* (   him. Clearly, someone had targeted her account specifically. No way) Tj
T* (   was he going to broadcast a new password for her account throughout) Tj
T* (   the underground. But the trouble was that neither Par nor Theorem knew) Tj
T* (   what Gandalf had done.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Meanwhile, Par called Theorem and got an earful. An angry Par vowed to) Tj
T* (   find out just who the hell had been messing with her account.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When the MOD boys told Par they were the culprits, he was a bit) Tj
T* (   surprised because he had always been on good terms with them. Par told) Tj

T* (   extraordinary thing happened. Corrupt, the toughest, baddest guy in) Tj
T* (   MOD, the black kid from the roughest part of New York, the hacker who) Tj
T* (   gave shit to everyone because he could, apologised to Par.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The MOD guys never apologised, even when they knew they were in the) Tj
T* (   wrong. Apologies never got anyone very far on a New York City street.) Tj
T* (   It was an attitude thing. `I'm sorry, man' from Corrupt was the) Tj
T* (   equivalent of a normal person licking the mud from the soles of your) Tj
T* (   shoes.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The new password was: M0Dm0dM0D. That's the kind of guys they were.) Tj

T* (   Par wanted to know, but at the same time, he didn't. He could have) Tj
T* (   arranged root access on Altos long ago if he'd really wanted it. But) Tj
T* (   he didn't. He didn't want it because it would mean he could access) Tj
T* (   Theorem's mail. And Par knew that if he could, he would. Theorem was) Tj
T* (   popular on Altos and, being the suspicious type, Par knew he would) Tj
T* (   probably take something perfectly innocent and read it the wrong way.) Tj
T* (   Then he would get in a fight with Theorem, and their time together was) Tj
T* (   too precious for that.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Too friendly,' Corrupt went on. It must have been hard for him to) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Thanks,' Par said finally. Then he took off.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Par tried out the MOD password, it didn't work of course, because) Tj

T* (   out that Theorem's account was disabled didn't bother him, but) Tj
T* (   discovering who disabled it for her didn't make Par all that happy.) Tj
T* (   Still, when he confronted Theorem, she denied that anything was going) Tj
T* (   on between her and Gandalf.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   What could Par do? He could believe Theorem or he could doubt her.) Tj
T* (   Believing her was hard, but doubting her was painful. So he chose to) Tj
T* (   believe her.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The incident made Theorem take a long look at Altos. It was doing bad) Tj
T* (   things to her life. In the days that she was locked out of the German) Tj

T* (   completely addicted. And she didn't like it at all. Staring at her) Tj
T* (   life with fresh eyes, she realised she had been ignoring her friends) Tj
T* (   and her life in Switzerland. What on earth was she doing, spending) Tj
T* (   every night in front of a computer screen?) Tj

T* (   Morty wasn't exactly Par's best friend, but he was all right. He had) Tj
T* (   been charged by the Feds a few months earlier for selling a password) Tj
T* (   to a credit record company which resulted in credit card fraud. Par) Tj
T* (   didn't go in for selling passwords, but to each his own. Morty wasn't) Tj

T* (   just Par the hacker.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was a strange sensation. These guys Par had never met before) Tj
T* (   chatted with him about the latest Michael Jackson video as if he was a) Tj
T* (   neighbour or friend just returned from out of town. Then they took him) Tj
T* (   further uptown, to a police station, for more extradition paperwork.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   This place was no World Trade Center deluxe office. Par stared at the) Tj
T* (   peeling grey paint in the ancient room, and then watched officers) Tj
T* (   typing out reports using the two-finger hunt-and-peck method on) Tj
T* (   electric typewriters--not a computer in sight. The officers didn't) Tj
T* (   cuff Par to the desk. Par was in the heart of a police station and) Tj
T* (   there was no way he was going anywhere.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   While the officer handling Par was away from his desk for ten minutes,) Tj
T* (   Par felt bored. So he began flipping through the folders with) Tj
T* (   information on other cases on the officer's desk. They were heavy duty) Tj
T* (   fraud cases--mafia and drug-money laundering--cases which carried) Tj
T* (   reference to FBI involvement. These people looked hairy.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   That day, Par had a quick appearance in court, just long enough to be) Tj
T* (   given protective custody in the Manhattan detention complex known as) Tj

T* (   the Tombs while he waited for the authorities from California to come) Tj
T* (   and pick him up.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par spent almost a week in the Tombs. By day three, he was climbing) Tj
T* (   the walls. It was like being buried alive.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   During that week, Par had almost no contact with other human beings--a) Tj
T* (   terrible punishment for someone with so much need for a continual flow) Tj
T* (   of new information. He never left his cell. His jailer slid trays of) Tj
T* (   food into his cell and took them away.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   On day six, Par went nuts. He threw a fit, began screaming and banging) Tj
T* (   on the door. He yelled at the guard. Told him none too nicely that he) Tj
T* (   wanted to `get the fuck outta here'. The guard said he would see if he) Tj
T* (   could get Par transferred to Rikers Island, New York's notorious jail.) Tj
T* (   Par didn't care if he was transferred to the moon, as long as he got) Tj
T* (   out of solitary confinement.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Except for the serial killer, the north infirmary at Rikers Island was) Tj
T* (   a considerable improvement on the Tombs. Par was only locked in his) Tj
T* (   cell at night. During the day he was free to roam inside the infirmary) Tj
T* (   area with other prisoners. Some of them were there because the) Tj
T* (   authorities didn't want to put them in with the hardened criminals,) Tj
T* (   and some of them were there because they were probably criminally) Tj
T* (   insane.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was an eclectic bunch. A fireman turned jewellery heister. A) Tj
T* (   Colombian drug lord. A chop-shop ringleader, who collected more than) Tj
T* (   300 stolen cars, chopped them up, reassembled them as new and then) Tj
T* (   sold them off. A man who killed a homosexual for coming onto him.) Tj
T* (   `Faggot Killer', as he was known inside, hadn't meant to kill anyone:) Tj
T* (   things had gotten a little out of hand; next thing he knew, he was) Tj
T* (   facing ten to twelve on a murder rap.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par wasn't wild about the idea of hanging out with a murderer, but he) Tj
T* (   was nervous about what could happened to a young man in jail. Forging) Tj
T* (   a friendship with Faggot Killer would send the right message. Besides,) Tj
T* (   the guy seemed to be OK. Well, as long as you didn't look at him the) Tj
T* (   wrong way.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   On his first day, Par also met Kentucky, a wild-eyed man who) Tj
T* (   introduced himself by thrusting a crumpled newspaper article into the) Tj
T* (   hacker's hand and saying, `That's me'. The article, titled `Voices) Tj
T* (   Told Him to Kill', described how police had apprehended a serial) Tj
T* (   killer believed to be responsible for a dozen murders, maybe more.) Tj
T* (   During his last murder, Kentucky told Par he had killed a woman--and) Tj
T* (   then written the names of the aliens who had commanded him to do it on) Tj
T* (   the walls of her apartment in her blood.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The jewellery heister tried to warn Par to stay away from Kentucky,) Tj
T* (   who continued to liaise with the aliens on a regular basis. But it was) Tj
T* (   too late. Kentucky decided that he didn't like the young hacker. He) Tj
T* (   started shouting at Par, picking a fight. Par stood there, stunned and) Tj
T* (   confused. How should he deal with an aggravated serial killer? And) Tj
T* (   what the hell was he doing in jail with a serial killer raving at him) Tj
T* (   anyway? It was all too much.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The jewellery heister rushed over to Kentucky and tried to calm him) Tj
T* (   down, speaking in soothing tones. Kentucky glowered at Par, but he) Tj
T* (   stopped yelling.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A few days into his stay at Rikers, Faggot Killer invited Par to join) Tj
T* (   in a game of Dungeons and Dragons. It beat watching TV talk shows all) Tj
T* (   day, so Par agreed. He sat down at the metal picnic table where Faggot) Tj
T* (   Killer had laid out the board.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   So it was that Par, the twenty-year-old computer hacker from) Tj
T* (   California, the X.25 network whiz kid, came to play Dungeons and) Tj
T* (   Dragons with a jewellery thief, a homophobic murderer and a mad serial) Tj
T* (   killer in Rikers Island. Par found himself marvelling at the) Tj
T* (   surrealism of the situation.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Kentucky threw himself into the game. He seemed to get off on killing) Tj
T* (   hobgoblins.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I'll take my halberd,' Kentucky began with a smile, `and I stab this) Tj
T* (   goblin.' The next player began to make his move, but Kentucky) Tj
T* (   interrupted. `I'm not done,' he said slowly, as a demonic grin spread) Tj
T* (   across his face. `And I slice it. And cut it. It bleeds everywhere.') Tj
T* (   Kentucky's face tensed with pleasure.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The other three players shifted uncomfortably in their seats. Par) Tj
T* (   looked at Faggot Killer with nervous eyes.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `And I thrust a knife into its heart,' Kentucky continued, the volume) Tj
T* (   of his voice rising with excitement. `Blood, blood, everywhere blood.) Tj
T* (   And I take the knife and hack him. And I hack and hack and hack.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Kentucky jumped up from the table and began shouting, thrusting one) Tj
T* (   arm downward through the air with an imaginary dagger, `And I hack and) Tj
T* (   I hack and I hack!') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then Kentucky went suddenly still. Everyone at the table froze. No-one) Tj
T* (   dared move for fear of driving him over the edge. Par's stomach had) Tj
T* (   jumped into his throat. He tried to gauge how many seconds it would) Tj
T* (   take to extricate himself from the picnic table and make a break for) Tj
T* (   the far side of the room.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In a daze, Kentucky walked away from the table, leaned his forehead) Tj
T* (   against the wall and began mumbling quietly. The jewellery heister) Tj
T* (   slowly followed and spoke to him briefly in hushed tones before) Tj
T* (   returning to the table.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   One of the guards had heard the ruckus and came up to the table.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Is that guy OK?' he asked the jewellery heister while pointing to) Tj
T* (   Kentucky.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Not even if you used that term loosely, Par thought.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Leave him alone,' the heister told the guard. `He's talking to the) Tj
T* (   aliens.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Right.' The guard turned around and left.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Every day, a nurse brought around special medicine for Kentucky. In) Tj
T* (   fact, Kentucky was zonked out most of the time on a cup of horrible,) Tj
T* (   smelly liquid. Sometimes, though, Kentucky secreted his medicine away) Tj
T* (   and traded it with another prisoner who wanted to get zonked out for a) Tj
T* (   day or so.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Those were bad days, the days when Kentucky had sold his medication.) Tj
T* (   It was on one of those days that he tried to kill Par.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par sat on a metal bench, talking to other prisoners, when suddenly he) Tj
T* (   felt an arm wrap around his neck. He tried to turn around, but) Tj
T* (   couldn't.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Here. I'll show you how I killed this one guy,' Kentucky whispered to) Tj
T* (   Par.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No--No--' Par started to say, but Kentucky's biceps began pressing) Tj
T* (   against Par's Adam's apple. It was a vice-like grip.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yeah. Like this. I did it like this,' Kentucky said as he tensed his) Tj
T* (   muscle and pulled backward.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No! Really, you don't need to. It's OK,' Par gasped. No air. His arms) Tj
T* (   flailing in front of him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   I'm done for, Par thought. My life is over. Hacker Murdered by Serial) Tj
T* (   Killer in Rikers Island. `Aliens Told Me to Do It.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The omnipresent jewellery heister came up to Kentucky and started) Tj
T* (   cooing in his ear to let Par go. Then, just when Par thought he was) Tj
T* (   about to pass out, the jewellery heister pulled Kentucky off him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par reminded himself to always sit with his back against the wall.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Finally, after almost a month behind bars, Par was informed that an) Tj
T* (   officer from the Monterey County sheriff's office was coming to take) Tj
T* (   him back to California. Par had agreed to be extradited to California) Tj
T* (   after seeing the inside of New York's jails. Dealing with the federal) Tj
T* (   prosecutor in New York had also helped make up his mind.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The US Attorney's Office in New York gave Richard Rosen, who had taken) Tj
T* (   the case on again, a real headache. They didn't play ball. They played) Tj
T* (   `Queen for a Day'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The way they negotiated reminded Rosen of an old American television) Tj
T* (   game of that name. The show's host pulled some innocent soul off the) Tj
T* (   street, seated her on a garish throne, asked her questions and then) Tj
T* (   gave her prizes. The US Attorney's Office in New York wanted to seat) Tj
T* (   Par on a throne, of sorts, to ask him lots of questions. At the end of) Tj
T* (   the unfettered interrogation, they would hand out prizes. Prison) Tj
T* (   terms. Fines. Convictions. As they saw fit. No guaranteed sentences.) Tj
T* (   They would decide what leniency, if any, he would get at the end of) Tj
T* (   the game.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par knew what they were looking for: evidence against the MOD boys. He) Tj
T* (   wasn't having a bar of that. The situation stank, so Par decided not to) Tj
T* (   fight the extradition to California. Anything had to be better than New) Tj
T* (   York, with its crazy jail inmates and arrogant federal prosecutors.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The officer from the Monterey sheriff's office picked Par up on 17) Tj
T* (   December 1991.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par spent the next few weeks in jail in California, but this time he) Tj
T* (   wasn't in any sort of protective custody. He had to share a cell with) Tj
T* (   Mexican drug dealers and other mafia, but at least he knew his way) Tj

T* (   around these people. And unlike the some of the people at Rikers, they) Tj
T* (   weren't stark raving lunatics.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Richard Rosen took the case back, despite Par's having skipped town) Tj
T* (   the first time, which Par thought was pretty good of the lawyer. But) Tj
T* (   Par had no idea how good it would be for him until it came to his) Tj
T* (   court date.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par called Rosen from the jail, to talk about the case. Rosen had some) Tj
T* (   big news for him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Plead guilty. You're going to plead guilty to everything,' he told) Tj
T* (   Par.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par thought Rosen had lost his marbles.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No. We can win this case if you plead guilty,' Rosen assured him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par sat dumbfounded at the other end of the phone.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Trust me,' the lawyer said.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The meticulous Richard Rosen had found a devastating weapon.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   On 23 December 1991, Par pleaded guilty to two charges in Monterey) Tj
T* (   County Juvenile Court. He admitted everything. The whole nine yards.) Tj
T* (   Yes, I am The Parmaster. Yes, I broke into computers. Yes, I took) Tj
T* (   thousands of credit card details from a Citibank machine. Yes, yes,) Tj
T* (   yes.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In some way, the experience was cathartic, but only because Par knew) Tj
T* (   Rosen had a brilliant ace up his sleeve.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Rosen had rushed the case to be sure it would be heard in juvenile) Tj
T* (   court, where Par would get a more lenient sentence. But just because) Tj
T* (   Rosen was in a hurry didn't mean he was sloppy. When he went through) Tj
T* (   Par's file with a fine-toothed comb he discovered the official papers) Tj
T* (   declared Par's birthday to be 15 January 1971. In fact, Par's birthday) Tj
T* (   was some days earlier, but the DA's office didn't know that.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Under California law, a juvenile court has jurisdiction over citizens) Tj
T* (   under the age of 21. You can only be tried and sentenced in a juvenile) Tj
T* (   court if you committed the crimes in question while under the age of) Tj
T* (   eighteen and you are still under the age of 21 when you plead and are) Tj
T* (   sentenced.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par was due to be sentenced on 13 January but on 8 January Rosen) Tj
T* (   applied for the case to be thrown out. When Deputy DA David Schott) Tj
T* (   asked why, Rosen dropped his bomb.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par had already turned 21 and the juvenile court had no authority to) Tj
T* (   pass sentence over him. Further, in California, a case cannot be moved) Tj
T* (   into an adult court if the defendant has already entered a plea in a) Tj
T* (   juvenile one. Because Par had already done that, his case couldn't be) Tj
T* (   moved. The matter was considered `dealt with' in the eyes of the law.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The Deputy DA was flabbergasted. He spluttered and spewed. The DA's) Tj
T* (   office had dropped the original charges from a felony to a) Tj
T* (   misdemeanour. They had come to the table. How could this happen? Par) Tj

T* (   the frigging Secret Service, for Christ's sake. There was no way--NO) Tj
T* (   WAY--he was going to walk out of that courtroom scot-free.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The court asked Par to prove his birthday. A quick driver's licence) Tj
T* (   search at the department of motor vehicles showed Par and his lawyer) Tj
T* (   were telling the truth. So Par walked free.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When he stepped outside the courthouse, Par turned his face toward the) Tj
T* (   sun. After almost two months in three different jails on two sides of) Tj
T* (   the continent, the sun felt magnificent. Walking around felt) Tj
T* (   wonderful. Just wandering down the street made him happy.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   However, Par never really got over being on the run.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   From the time he walked free from the County Jail in Salinas,) Tj
T* (   California, he continued to move around the country, picking up) Tj
T* (   temporary work here and there. But he found it hard to settle in one) Tj
T* (   place. Worst of all, strange things began happening to him. Well, they) Tj
T* (   had always happened to him, but they were getting stranger by the) Tj
T* (   month. His perception of reality was changing.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   There was the incident in the motel room. As Par sat in the Las Vegas) Tj
T* (   Travelodge on one if his cross-country treks, he perceived someone) Tj
T* (   moving around in the room below his. Par strained to hear. It seemed) Tj
T* (   like the man was talking to him. What was the man trying to tell him?) Tj
T* (   Par couldn't quite catch the words, but the more he listened, the more) Tj
T* (   Par was sure he had a message for him which he didn't want anyone else) Tj
T* (   to hear. It was very frustrating. No matter how hard he tried, no) Tj
T* (   matter how he put his ear down to the floor or against the wall, Par) Tj
T* (   couldn't make it out.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The surreal experiences continued. As Par described it, on a trip down) Tj
T* (   to Mexico, he began feeling quite strange, so he went to the US) Tj
T* (   consulate late one afternoon to get some help. But everyone in the) Tj
T* (   consulate behaved bizarrely.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   They asked him for some identification, and he gave them his wallet.) Tj
T* (   They took his Social Security card and his California identification) Tj
T* (   card and told him to wait. Par believed they were going to pull up) Tj
T* (   information about him on a computer out the back. While waiting, his) Tj
T* (   legs began to tremble and a continuous shiver rolled up and down his) Tj
T* (   spine. It wasn't a smooth, fluid shiver, it was jerky. He felt like he) Tj
T* (   was sitting at the epicentre of an earthquake and it frightened him.) Tj
T* (   The consulate staff just stared) Tj
T* (   at him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Finally Par stopped shaking. The other staff member returned and asked) Tj
T* (   him to leave.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No-one can help you here,' he told Par.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Why was the consular official talking to him like that? What did he) Tj
T* (   mean--Par had to leave? What was he really trying to say? Par couldn't) Tj
T* (   understand him. Another consular officer came around to Par, carrying) Tj
T* (   handcuffs. Why was everyone behaving in such a weird way? That) Tj
T* (   computer. Maybe they had found some special message next to his name) Tj
T* (   on that computer.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par tried to explain the situation, but the consulate staff didn't) Tj
T* (   seem to understand. He told them about how he had been on the run from) Tj

T* (   the Secret Service for two and a half years, but that just got him) Tj
T* (   queer looks. Blank faces. No comprehende. The more he explained, the) Tj
T* (   blanker the faces became.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The consular officials told him that the office was closing for the) Tj
T* (   day. He would have to leave the building. But Par suspected that was) Tj
T* (   just an excuse. A few minutes later, a Mexican policeman showed up. He) Tj
T* (   talked with one of the consular officials, who subsequently handed him) Tj
T* (   what Par perceived to be a slip of paper wrapped around a wad of peso) Tj
T* (   notes.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Two more policemen came into the consulate. One of them turned to Par) Tj
T* (   and said, `Leave!' but Par didn't answer. So the Mexican police) Tj
T* (   grabbed Par by the arms and legs and carried him out of the consulate.) Tj
T* (   Par felt agitated and confused and, as they crossed the threshold out) Tj
T* (   of the consulate, he screamed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   They put him in a police car and took him to a jail, where they kept) Tj
T* (   him overnight.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The next day, they released Par and he wandered the city aimlessly) Tj
T* (   before ending up back at the US consulate. The same consular officer) Tj
T* (   came up to him and asked how he was feeling.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par said, `OK.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then Par asked if the official could help him get back to the border,) Tj
T* (   and he said he could. A few minutes later a white van picked up Par) Tj
T* (   and took him to the border crossing. When they arrived, Par asked the) Tj
T* (   driver if he could have $2 so he could buy a ticket for the train. The) Tj
T* (   driver gave it to him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Par boarded the train with no idea of where he was headed.) Tj

T* (   the $20000 she had lent him during his years on the run and during his) Tj
T* (   court case, but it was hard going. People didn't seem to want to hire) Tj
T* (   him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `You don't have any computer skills,' they told him. He calmly) Tj
T* (   explained that, yes, he did indeed have computer skills.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Well, which university did you get your degree from?' they asked.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   No, he hadn't got his skills at any university.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Well, which companies did you get your work experience from?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   card details as its Saudi-American counterpart. Out of fifteen or so) Tj
T* (   credit cards Force discovered on the system, only two appeared to be) Tj
T* (   valid. He figured the others were test cards and that this must be a) Tj
T* (   new site. Not long after the discovery of the CitiGreece machine, he) Tj
T* (   discovered similar embryonic sites in two other countries.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Force liked Phoenix and was impressed by the new hacker's enthusiasm) Tj
T* (   and desire to learn about computer networks.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Force introduced Phoenix to Minerva, just as Craig Bowen had done for) Tj
T* (   Force some years before. Phoenix learned quickly and came back for) Tj
T* (   more. He was hungry and, in Force's discerning opinion, very bright.) Tj
T* (   Indeed, Force saw a great deal of himself in the young hacker. They) Tj
T* (   were from a similarly comfortable, educated middle-class background.) Tj
T* (   They were also both a little outside the mainstream. Force's family) Tj
T* (   were migrants to Australia. Some of Phoenix's family lived in Israel,) Tj
T* (   and his family was very religious.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix attended one of the most Orthodox Jewish schools in Victoria,) Tj
T* (   a place which described itself as a `modern orthodox Zionist') Tj
T* (   institution. Nearly half the subjects offered in year 9 were in Jewish) Tj
T* (   Studies, all the boys wore yarmulkes and the school expected students) Tj
T* (   to be fluent in Hebrew by the time they graduated.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In his first years at the school, Phoenix had acquired the nickname) Tj
T* (   `The Egg'. Over the following years he became a master at playing the) Tj
T* (   game--jumping through hoops to please teachers. He learned that doing) Tj
T* (   well in religious studies was a good way to ingratiate himself to) Tj
T* (   teachers, as well as his parents and, in their eyes at least, he) Tj
T* (   became the golden-haired boy.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anyone scratching below the surface, however, would find the shine of) Tj
T* (   the golden-haired boy was merely gilt. Despite his success in school) Tj
T* (   and his matriculation, Phoenix was having trouble. He had been) Tj
T* (   profoundly affected by the bitter break-up and divorce of his parents) Tj
T* (   when he was about fourteen.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After the divorce, Phoenix was sent to boarding school in Israel for) Tj
T* (   about six months. On his return to Melbourne, he lived with his) Tj
T* (   younger sister and mother at his maternal grandmother's house. His) Tj
T* (   brother, the middle child, lived with his father.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   School friends sometimes felt awkward visiting Phoenix at home. One of) Tj
T* (   his best friends found it difficult dealing with Phoenix's mother,) Tj
T* (   whose vivacity sometimes bordered on the neurotic and shrill. His) Tj
T* (   grandmother was a chronic worrier, who pestered Phoenix about using) Tj
T* (   the home phone line during thunderstorms for fear he would be) Tj
T* (   electrocuted. The situation with Phoenix's father wasn't much better.) Tj
T* (   A manager at Telecom, he seemed to waver between appearing) Tj
T* (   disinterested or emotionally cold and breaking into violent outbursts) Tj
T* (   of anger.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But it was Phoenix's younger brother who seemed to be the problem) Tj

T* (   problems had been laid bare for all to see. Hitting rock bottom forced) Tj
T* (   him to take stock of his life and come to terms with his situation.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In contrast, Phoenix found less noticeable ways of expressing his) Tj
T* (   rebellion. Among them was his enthusiasm for tools of power--the) Tj
T* (   martial arts, weapons such as swords and staffs, and social) Tj
T* (   engineering. During his final years of secondary school, while still) Tj
T* (   living at his grandmother's home, Phoenix took up hacking. He hung) Tj
T* (   around various Melbourne BBSes, and then he developed an on-line) Tj
T* (   friendship with Force.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Force watched Phoenix's hacking skills develop with interest and after) Tj
T* (   a couple of months he invited him to join The Realm. It was the) Tj
T* (   shortest initiation of any Realm member, and the vote to include the) Tj
T* (   new hacker was unanimous. Phoenix proved to be a valuable member,) Tj
T* (   collecting information about new systems and networks for The Realm's) Tj
T* (   databases. At their peak of hacking activity, Force and Phoenix spoke) Tj
T* (   on the phone almost every day.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix's new-found acceptance contrasted with the position of) Tj
T* (   Electron, who visited The Realm regularly for a few months in 1988. As) Tj
T* (   Phoenix basked in the warmth of Force's approval, the) Tj
T* (   eighteen-year-old Electron felt the chill of his increasing scorn.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Force eventually turfed Electron and his friend, Powerspike, out of) Tj
T* (   his exclusive Melbourne club of hackers. Well, that was how Force told) Tj
T* (   it. He told the other members of The Realm that Electron had committed) Tj
T* (   two major sins. The first was that he had been wasting resources by) Tj
T* (   using accounts on OTC's Minerva system to connect to Altos, which) Tj
T* (   meant the accounts would be immediately tracked and killed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Minerva admins such as Michael Rosenberg--sworn enemy of The) Tj
T* (   Realm--recognised the Altos NUA. Rosenberg was OTC's best defence) Tj
T* (   against hackers. He had spent so much time trying to weed them out of) Tj
T* (   Minerva that he knew their habits by heart: hack, then zoom over to) Tj
T* (   Altos for a chat with fellow hackers, then hack some more.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Most accounts on Minerva were held by corporations. How many) Tj
T* (   legitimate users from ANZ Bank would visit Altos? None. So when) Tj
T* (   Rosenberg saw an account connecting to Altos, he silently observed) Tj
T* (   what the hacker was doing--in case he bragged on the German chat) Tj
T* (   board--then changed the password and notified the client, in an effort) Tj
T* (   to lock the hacker out for good.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron's second sin, according to Force, was that he had been) Tj
T* (   withholding hacking information from the rest of the group. Force's) Tj
T* (   stated view--though it didn't seem to apply to him personally--was one) Tj
T* (   in, all in.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was a very public expulsion. Powerspike and Electron told each) Tj
T* (   other they didn't really care. As they saw it, they might have visited) Tj
T* (   The Realm BBS now and then but they certainly weren't members of The) Tj
T* (   Realm. Electron joked with Powerspike, `Who would want to be a member) Tj
T* (   of a no-talent outfit like The Realm?' Still, it must have hurt.) Tj
T* (   Hackers in the period 1988-90 depended on each other for information.) Tj
T* (   They honed their skills in a community which shared intelligence and) Tj
T* (   they grew to rely on the pool of information.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Months later, Force grudgingly allowing Electron to rejoin The Realm,) Tj
T* (   but the relationship remained testy. When Electron finally logged in) Tj

T* (   again, he found a file in the BBS entitled `Scanner stolen from the) Tj
T* (   Electron'. Force had found a copy of Electron's VMS scanner on an) Tj
T* (   overseas computer while Electron was in exile and had felt no qualms) Tj
T* (   about pinching it for The Realm.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Except that it wasn't a scanner. It was a VMS Trojan. And there was a) Tj
T* (   big difference. It didn't scan for the addresses of computers on a) Tj
T* (   network. It snagged passwords when people connected from their VMS) Tj
T* (   computers to another machine over an X.25 network. Powerspike cracked) Tj
T* (   up laughing when Electron told him. `Well,' he told Powerspike, `Mr) Tj
T* (   Bigshot Force might know something about Prime computers, but he) Tj
T* (   doesn't know a hell of a lot about VMS.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Despite Electron's general fall from grace, Phoenix talked to the) Tj
T* (   outcast because they shared the obsession. Electron was on a steep) Tj
T* (   learning curve and, like Phoenix, he was moving fast--much faster than) Tj
T* (   any of the other Melbourne hackers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Phoenix admitted talking to Electron regularly, Force tried to) Tj
T* (   pull him away, but without luck. Some of the disapproval was born of) Tj
T* (   Force's paternalistic attitude toward the Australian hacking scene. He) Tj
T* (   considered himself to be a sort of godfather in the hacking community.) Tj
T* (   But Force was also increasingly concerned at Phoenix's ever more) Tj
T* (   flagrant taunting of computer security bigwigs and system admins. In) Tj
T* (   one incident, Phoenix knew a couple of system admins and security) Tj
T* (   people were waiting on a system to trap him by tracing his network) Tj
T* (   connections. He responded by sneaking into the computer unnoticed and) Tj
T* (   quietly logging off each admin. Force laughed about it at the time,) Tj
T* (   but privately the story made him more than a little nervous.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix enjoyed pitting himself against the pinnacles of the computer) Tj
T* (   security industry. He wanted to prove he was better, and he frequently) Tj
T* (   upset people because often he was. Strangely, though, Force's protÈgÈ) Tj
T* (   also thought that if he told these experts about a few of the holes in) Tj
T* (   their systems, he would somehow gain their approval. Maybe they would) Tj
T* (   even give him inside information, like new penetration techniques,) Tj
T* (   and, importantly, look after him if things got rough. Force wondered) Tj
T* (   how Phoenix could hold two such conflicting thoughts in his mind at) Tj
T* (   the same time without questioning the logic of either.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was against this backdrop that Gavin came to Force with his urgent) Tj
T* (   warning in late 1989. Gavin had learned that the Australian Federal) Tj
T* (   Police were getting complaints about hackers operating out of) Tj
T* (   Melbourne. The Melbourne hacking community had become very noisy and) Tj
T* (   was leaving footprints all over the place as its members traversed the) Tj
T* (   world's data networks.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   There were other active hacking communities outside Australia--in the) Tj
T* (   north of England, in Texas, in New York. But the Melbourne hackers) Tj
T* (   weren't just noisy--they were noisy inside American computers. It) Tj
T* (   wasn't just a case of American hackers breaking into American systems.) Tj
T* (   This was about foreign nationals penetrating American computers. And) Tj
T* (   there was something else which made the Australian hackers a target.) Tj
T* (   The US Secret Service knew an Australian named Phoenix had been inside) Tj
T* (   Citibank, one of the biggest financial institutions in the US.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Gavin didn't have many details to give Force. All he knew was that an) Tj
T* (   American law enforcement agency--probably the Secret Service--had been) Tj
T* (   putting enormous pressure on the Australian government to bust these) Tj
T* (   people.) Tj

T* (   What Gavin didn't know was that the Secret Service wasn't the only) Tj
T* (   source of pressure coming from the other side of the Pacific. The FBI) Tj
T* (   had also approached the Australian Federal Police about the mysterious) Tj
T* (   but noisy Australian hackers who kept breaking into American systems,5) Tj
T* (   and the AFP had acted on the information.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In late 1989, Detective Superintendent Ken Hunt of the AFP headed an) Tj
T* (   investigation into the Melbourne hackers. It was believed to be the) Tj
T* (   first major investigation of computer crime since the introduction of) Tj
T* (   Australia's first federal anti-hacking laws. Like most law enforcement) Tj
T* (   agencies around the world, the AFP were new players in the field of) Tj

T* (   computer crime, so this case would prove to be an important proving) Tj
T* (   ground.6) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Gavin broke the news, Force acted immediately. He called Phoenix) Tj
T* (   on the phone, insisting on meeting him in person as soon as possible.) Tj
T* (   As their friendship had progressed, they had moved from talking) Tj
T* (   on-line to telephone conversations and finally to spending time) Tj
T* (   together in person. Force sat Phoenix down alone and gave him a stern) Tj
T* (   warning. He didn't tell him how he got his information, but he made it) Tj
T* (   clear the source was reliable.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The word was that the police felt they had to bust someone. It had) Tj
T* (   come to the point where an American law enforcement officer had) Tj
T* (   reportedly told his Australian counterpart, `If you don't do something) Tj
T* (   about it soon, we'll do something about it ourselves'. The American) Tj
T* (   hadn't bothered to elaborate on just how they might do something about) Tj
T* (   it, but it didn't matter.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix looked suddenly pale. He had certainly been very noisy, and) Tj
T* (   was breaking into systems virtually all the time now. Many of those) Tj
T* (   systems were in the US.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He certainly didn't want to end up like the West German hacker) Tj
T* (   Hagbard, whose petrol-doused, charred remains had been discovered in a) Tj
T* (   German forest in June 1989.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   An associate of Pengo's, Hagbard had been involved in a ring of German) Tj
T* (   hackers who sold the information they found in American computers to a) Tj
T* (   KGB agent in East Germany from 1986 to 1988.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In March 1989, German police raided the homes and offices of the) Tj

T* (   gaining immunity from prosecution.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   American law enforcement agencies and prosecutors had not been) Tj
T* (   enthusiastic about showing the hackers any leniency. Several US) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `The dictionary file. The words to feed into the password cracker,') Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   If he was lucky, he would find six or more accounts--user names and) Tj
T* (   their passwords--waiting for him in a file. The process was completely) Tj
T* (   automated. Electron could then log into Melbourne University using the) Tj
T* (   cracked accounts, all of which could be used as jumping-off points for) Tj
T* (   hacking into other systems for the price of a local telephone call.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Cracking Unix passwords wasn't inordinately difficult,) Tj
T* (   provided the different components of the program, such as the) Tj
T* (   dictionary, had been set up properly. However, it was time-consuming.) Tj
T* (   The principle was simple. Passwords, kept in password files with their) Tj
T* (   corresponding user names, were encrypted. It was as impossible to) Tj
T* (   reverse the encryption process as it was to unscramble an omelette.) Tj
T* (   Instead, you needed to recreate the encryption process and compare the) Tj
T* (   results.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   There were three basic steps. First, target a computer and get a copy) Tj
T* (   of its password file. Second, take a list of commonly used passwords,) Tj
T* (   such as users' names from the password file or words from a) Tj
T* (   dictionary, and encrypt those into a second list. Third, put the two) Tj
T* (   lists side by side and compare them. When you have a match, you have) Tj
T* (   found the password.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   However, there was one important complication: salts. A salt changed) Tj
T* (   the way a password was encrypted, subtly modifying the way the DES) Tj
T* (   encryption algorithm worked. For example, the word `Underground') Tj
T* (   encrypts two different ways with two different salts: `kyvbExMcdAOVM') Tj
T* (   or `lhFaTmw4Ddrjw'. The first two characters represent the salt, the) Tj
T* (   others represent the password. The computer chooses a salt randomly) Tj
T* (   when it encrypts a user's password. Only one is used, and there are) Tj
T* (   4096 different salts. All Unix computers use salts in their password) Tj
T* (   encryption process.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Salts were intended to make password cracking far more difficult, so a) Tj
T* (   hacker couldn't just encrypt a dictionary once and then compare it to) Tj
T* (   every list of encrypted passwords he came across in his hacking) Tj
T* (   intrusions. The 4096 salts mean that a hacker would have to use 4096) Tj
T* (   different dictionaries--each encrypted with a different salt--to) Tj
T* (   discover any dictionary word passwords.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   On any one system penetrated by Electron, there might be only 25) Tj
T* (   users, and therefore only 25 passwords, most likely using 25 different) Tj
T* (   salts. Since the salt characters were stored immediately before the) Tj
T* (   encrypted password, he could easily see which salt was being used for) Tj
T* (   a particular password. He would therefore only have to encrypt a) Tj
T* (   dictionary 25 different times.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Still, even encrypting a large dictionary 25 times using different) Tj
T* (   salts took up too much hard-drive space for a basic home computer. And) Tj
T* (   that was just the dictionary. The most sophisticated cracking programs) Tj
T* (   also produced `intelligent guesses' of passwords. For example, the) Tj
T* (   program might take the user's name and try it in both upper- and) Tj
T* (   lower-case letters. It might also add a `1' at the end. In short, the) Tj
T* (   program would create new guesses by permutating, shuffling, reversing) Tj
T* (   and recombining basic information such as a user's name into new) Tj
T* (   `words'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `It's 24000 words. Too damn big,' Electron said. Paring down a) Tj
T* (   dictionary was a game of trade-offs. The fewer words in a cracking) Tj
T* (   dictionary, the less time it was likely to take a computer to break) Tj

T* (   `Dunno. Yeah. I've got those. Not Cabbala. OK, Cabaret. Cabbage. Fuck,) Tj
T* (   I hate cabbage. Who'd pick Cabbage as their password?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `A Pom,' Electron answered.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yeah,' Phoenix laughed before continuing.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix sometimes stopped to think about Force's warning, but usually) Tj
T* (   he just pushed it to one side when it crept, unwelcomed, into his) Tj
T* (   thoughts. Still, it worried him. Force took it seriously enough. Not) Tj
T* (   only had he stopped associating with Electron, he appeared to have) Tj
T* (   gone very, very quiet.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In fact, Force had found a new love: music. He was writing and) Tj
T* (   performing his own songs. By early 1990 he seemed so busy with his) Tj
T* (   music that he had essentially put The Realm on ice. Its members took) Tj
T* (   to congregating on a machine owned by another Realm member, Nom, for a) Tj
T* (   month or so.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Somehow, however, Phoenix knew that wasn't all of the story. A hacker) Tj
T* (   didn't pick up and walk away from hacking just like that. Especially) Tj
T* (   not Force. Force had been obsessed with hacking. It just didn't make) Tj
T* (   sense. There had to be something more. Phoenix comforted himself with) Tj
T* (   the knowledge that he had followed Force's advice and had stayed away) Tj
T* (   from Electron. Well, for a while anyway.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He had backed right off, watched and waited, but nothing happened.) Tj
T* (   Electron was as active in the underground as ever but he hadn't been) Tj
T* (   busted. Nothing had changed. Maybe Force's information had been wrong.) Tj
T* (   Surely the feds would have busted Electron by now if they were going) Tj
T* (   to do anything. So Phoenix began to rebuild his relationship with) Tj
T* (   Electron. It was just too tempting. Phoenix was determined not to let) Tj
T* (   Force's ego impede his own progress.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   By January 1990, Electron was hacking almost all the time. The only) Tj
T* (   time he wasn't hacking was when he was sleeping, and even then he) Tj
T* (   often dreamed of hacking. He and Phoenix were sailing past all the) Tj
T* (   other Melbourne hackers. Electron had grown beyond Powerspike's) Tj
T* (   expertise just as Phoenix had accelerated past Force. They were moving) Tj
T* (   away from X.25 networks and into the embryonic Internet, which was) Tj
T* (   just as illegal since the universities guarded computer) Tj

T* (   Even Nom, with his growing expertise in the Unix operating system) Tj
T* (   which formed the basis of many new Internet sites, wasn't up to) Tj
T* (   Electron's standard. He didn't have the same level of commitment to) Tj
T* (   hacking, the same obsession necessary to be a truly cutting-edge) Tj
T* (   hacker. In many ways, the relationship between Nom and Phoenix) Tj
T* (   mirrored the relationship between Electron and Powerspike: the support) Tj
T* (   act to the main band.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron didn't consider Phoenix a close friend, but he was a kindred) Tj
T* (   spirit. In fact he didn't trust Phoenix, who had a big mouth, a big) Tj
T* (   ego and a tight friendship with Force--all strikes against him. But) Tj
T* (   Phoenix was intelligent and he wanted to learn. Most of all, he had) Tj
T* (   the obsession. Phoenix contributed to a flow of information which) Tj
T* (   stimulated Electron intellectually, even if more information flowed) Tj
T* (   toward Phoenix than from him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Within a month, Phoenix and Electron were in regular contact, and) Tj
T* (   during the summer holidays they were talking on the phone--voice--all) Tj
T* (   the time, sometimes three or four times a day. Hack then talk. Compare) Tj
T* (   notes. Hack some more. Check in again, ask a few questions. Then back) Tj
T* (   to hacking.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The actual hacking was generally a solo act. For a social animal like) Tj
T* (   Phoenix, it was a lonely pursuit. While many hackers revelled in the) Tj
T* (   intense isolation, some, such as Phoenix, also needed to check in with) Tj
T* (   fellow humanity once in a while. Not just any humanity--those who) Tj
T* (   understood and shared in the obsession.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Caboodle. Caboose, `Electron went on, `Cabriolet. What the hell is a) Tj
T* (   Cabriolet? Do you know?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yeah,' Phoenix answered, then rushed on. `OK. Cacao. Cache. Cachet) Tj
T* (   ...') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Tell us. What is it?' Electron cut Phoenix off.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Cachinnation. Cachou ...') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Do you know?' Electron asked again, slightly irritated. As usual,) Tj
T* (   Phoenix was claiming to know things he probably didn't.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Hmm? Uh, yeah,' Phoenix answered weakly. `Cackle. Cacophony ...') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron knew that particular Phoenix `yeah'--the one which said `yes') Tj
T* (   but meant `no, and I don't want to own up to it either so let's drop) Tj
T* (   it'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron made it a habit not to believe most of the things Phoenix) Tj
T* (   told him. Unless there was some solid proof, Electron figured it was) Tj
T* (   just hot air. He didn't actually like Phoenix much as a person, and) Tj
T* (   found talking to him difficult at times. He preferred the company of) Tj
T* (   his fellow hacker Powerspike.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Powerspike was both bright and creative. Electron clicked with him.) Tj
T* (   They often joked about the other's bad taste in music. Powerspike) Tj
T* (   liked heavy metal, and Electron liked indie music. They shared a) Tj
T* (   healthy disrespect for authority. Not just the authority of places) Tj
T* (   they hacked into, like the US Naval Research Laboratories or NASA, but) Tj
T* (   the authority of The Realm. When it came to politics, they both leaned) Tj
T* (   to the left. However, their interest tended more toward) Tj

T* (   joining a political party.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After their expulsion from The Realm, Electron had been a little) Tj
T* (   isolated for a time. The tragedy of his personal life had contributed) Tj
T* (   to the isolation. At the age of eight, he had seen his mother die of) Tj
T* (   lung cancer. He hadn't witnessed the worst parts of her dying over two) Tj
T* (   years, as she had spent some time in a German cancer clinic hoping for) Tj
T* (   a reprieve. She had, however, come home to die, and Electron had) Tj
T* (   watched her fade away.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When the phone call from hospital came one night, Electron could tell) Tj
T* (   what had happened from the serious tones of the adults. He burst into) Tj
T* (   tears. He could hear his father answering questions on the phone. Yes,) Tj
T* (   the boy had taken it hard. No, his sister seemed to be OK. Two years) Tj
T* (   younger than Electron, she was too young to understand.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron had never been particularly close to his sister. He viewed) Tj
T* (   her as an unfeeling, shallow person--someone who simply skimmed along) Tj
T* (   the surface of life. But after their mother's death, their father) Tj
T* (   began to favour Electron's sister, perhaps because of her resemblance) Tj
T* (   to his late wife. This drove a deeper, more subtle wedge between) Tj
T* (   brother and sister.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron's father, a painter who taught art at a local high school,) Tj
T* (   was profoundly affected by his wife's death. Despite some barriers of) Tj
T* (   social class and money, theirs had been a marriage of great affection) Tj
T* (   and love and they made a happy home. Electron's father's paintings) Tj
T* (   hung on almost every wall in the house, but after his wife's death he) Tj
T* (   put down his brushes and never took them up again. He didn't talk) Tj
T* (   about it. Once, Electron asked him why he didn't paint any more. He) Tj
T* (   looked away and told Electron that he had `lost the motivation'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron's grandmother moved into the home to help her son care for) Tj
T* (   his two children, but she developed Alzheimer's disease. The children) Tj
T* (   ended up caring for her. As a teenager, Electron thought it was) Tj
T* (   maddening caring for someone who couldn't even remember your name.) Tj
T* (   Eventually, she moved into a nursing home.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In August 1989, Electron's father arrived home from the doctor's) Tj
T* (   office. He had been mildly ill for some time, but refused to take time) Tj
T* (   off work to visit a doctor. He was proud of having taken only one) Tj
T* (   day's sick leave in the last five years. Finally, in the holidays, he) Tj
T* (   had seen a doctor who had conducted numerous tests. The results had) Tj
T* (   come in.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron's father had bowel cancer and the disease had spread. It) Tj
T* (   could not be cured. He had two years to live at the most.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron was nineteen years old at the time, and his early love of the) Tj
T* (   computer, and particularly the modem, had already turned into a) Tj
T* (   passion. Several years earlier his father, keen to encourage his) Tj
T* (   fascination with the new machines, used to bring one of the school's) Tj
T* (   Apple IIes home over weekends and holidays. Electron spent hours at) Tj
T* (   the borrowed machine. When he wasn't playing on the computer, he read,) Tj
T* (   plucking one of his father's spy novels from the over-crowded) Tj
T* (   bookcases, or his own favourite book, The Lord of The Rings.) Tj

T* (   games--despite the fact that he had never actually touched a keyboard.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   His school may have had a few computers, but its administrators had) Tj
T* (   little understanding of what to do with them. In year 9, Electron had) Tj
T* (   met with the school's career counsellor, hoping to learn about career) Tj
T* (   options working with computers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I think maybe I'd like to do a course in computer programming ...') Tj
T* (   His voice trailed off, hesitantly.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Why would you want to do that?' she said. `Can't you think of) Tj
T* (   anything better than that?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Uhm ...' Electron was at a loss. He didn't know what to do. That was) Tj
T* (   why he had come to her. He cast around for something which seemed a) Tj
T* (   more mainstream career option but which might also let him work on) Tj
T* (   computers. `Well, accounting maybe?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Oh yes, that's much better,' she said.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   his file.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The borrowed computers were, in Electron's opinion, one of the few) Tj
T* (   good things about school. He did reasonably well at school, but only) Tj
T* (   because it didn't take much effort. Teachers consistently told his) Tj
T* (   father that Electron was underachieving and that he distracted the) Tj
T* (   other students in class. For the most part, the criticism was just) Tj
T* (   low-level noise. Occasionally, however, Electron had more serious) Tj
T* (   run-ins with his teachers. Some thought he was gifted. Others thought) Tj

T* (   to textbooks at the back of the class was nothing but a smart alec.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When he was sixteen, Electron bought his own computer. He used it to) Tj
T* (   crack software protection, just as Par had done. The Apple was soon) Tj
T* (   replaced by a more powerful Amiga with a 20 megabyte IBM compatible) Tj
T* (   sidecar. The computers lived, in succession, on one of the two desks) Tj
T* (   in his bedroom. The second desk, for his school work, was usually) Tj
T* (   piled high with untouched assignments.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The most striking aspect of Electron's room was the ream after ream of) Tj
T* (   dot matrix computer print-out which littered the floor. Standing at) Tj
T* (   almost any point in the simply furnished room, someone could reach out) Tj
T* (   and grab at least one pile of print-outs, most of which contained) Tj
T* (   either usernames and passwords or printed computer program code. In) Tj
T* (   between the piles of print-outs, were T-shirts, jeans, sneakers and) Tj
T* (   books on the floor. It was impossible to walk across Electron's room) Tj
T* (   without stepping on something.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The turning point for Electron was the purchase of a second-hand 300) Tj
T* (   baud modem in 1986. Overnight, the modem transformed Electron's love) Tj
T* (   of the computer into an obsession. During the semester immediately) Tj
T* (   before the modem's arrival, Electron's report card showed six As and) Tj
T* (   one B. The following semester he earned six Bs and only one A.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   He kept it low-key, so as not to bruise Phoenix's ego. Often Electron) Tj

T* (   subtle, perhaps even unconscious search.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Nah,' Electron began, `See, someone might use the whole word,) Tj

T* (   Connery. Run by Neil Gorsuch, the Zardoz mailing list contained) Tj
T* (   articles, or postings, from various members of the computer security) Tj
T* (   industry. The postings discussed newly discovered bugs--problems with) Tj
T* (   a computer system which could be exploited to break into or gain root) Tj
T* (   access on a machine. The beauty of the bugs outlined in Zardoz was) Tj
T* (   that they worked on any computer system using the programs or) Tj
T* (   operating systems it described. Any university, any military system,) Tj
T* (   any research institute which ran the software documented in Zardoz was) Tj

T* (   virtually every lock.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   True, system administrators who read a particular Zardoz posting might) Tj
T* (   take steps to close up that security hole. But as the hacking) Tj
T* (   community knew well, it was a long time between a Zardoz posting and a) Tj

T* (   preferably with a large institution such as a university or a research) Tj

T* (   security bug.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Most good hackers had come across one or two issues of Zardoz in their) Tj
T* (   travels, often while rummaging though the system administrator's mail) Tj
T* (   on a prestigious institution's computer. But no-one from the elite of) Tj
T* (   the Altos underground had a full archive of all the back issues. The) Tj
T* (   hacker who possessed that would have details of every major security) Tj
T* (   hole discovered by the world's best computer security minds since at) Tj
T* (   least 1988.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Like Zardoz, Deszip was well guarded. It was written by computer) Tj
T* (   security expert Dr Matthew Bishop, who worked at NASA's Research) Tj
T* (   Institute for Advanced Computer Science before taking up a teaching) Tj
T* (   position at Dartmouth, an Ivy League college in New Hampshire. The) Tj
T* (   United States government deemed Deszip's very fast encryption) Tj
T* (   algorithms to be so important, they were classified as armaments. It) Tj
T* (   was illegal to export them from the US.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Of course, few hackers in 1990 had the sophistication to use weapons) Tj
T* (   such as Zardoz and Deszip properly. Indeed, few even knew they) Tj
T* (   existed. But Electron and Phoenix knew, along with a tiny handful of) Tj
T* (   others, including Pad and Gandalf from Britain. Congregating on Altos) Tj
T* (   in Germany, they worked with a select group of others carefully) Tj
T* (   targeting sites likely to contain parts of their holy grail. They were) Tj
T* (   methodical and highly strategic, piecing information together with) Tj
T* (   exquisite, almost forensic, skill. While the common rabble of other) Tj
T* (   hackers were thumping their heads against walls in brute-force attacks) Tj
T* (   on random machines, these hackers spent their time hunting for) Tj
T* (   strategic pressure points--the Achilles' heels of the computer) Tj
T* (   security community.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   They had developed an informal hit list of machines, most of which) Tj
T* (   belonged to high-level computer security gurus. Finding one or two) Tj
T* (   early issues of Zardoz, Electron had combed through their postings) Tj
T* (   looking not just on the surface--for the security bugs--but also) Tj
T* (   paying careful attention to the names and addresses of the people) Tj
T* (   writing articles. Authors who appeared frequently in Zardoz, or had) Tj
T* (   something intelligent to say, went on the hit list. It was those) Tj
T* (   people who were most likely to keep copies of Deszip or an archive of) Tj
T* (   Zardoz on their machines.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron had searched across the world for information about Deszip) Tj
T* (   and DES \(Data Encryption Standard\), the original encryption program) Tj
T* (   later used in Deszip. He hunted through computers at the University of) Tj
T* (   New York, the US Naval Research Laboratories in Washington DC,) Tj
T* (   Helsinki University of Technology, Rutgers University in New Jersey,) Tj
T* (   Melbourne University and Tampere University in Finland, but the search) Tj
T* (   bore little fruit. He found a copy of CDES, a public domain encryption) Tj
T* (   program which used the DES algorithm, but not Deszip. CDES could be) Tj
T* (   used to encrypt files but not to crack passwords.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The two Australian hackers had, however, enjoyed a small taste of) Tj
T* (   Deszip. In 1989 they had broken into a computer at Dartmouth College) Tj
T* (   called Bear. They discovered Deszip carefully tucked away in a corner) Tj
T* (   of Bear and had spirited a copy of the program away to a safer machine) Tj
T* (   at another institution.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It turned out to be a hollow victory. That copy of Deszip had been) Tj
T* (   encrypted with Crypt, a program based on the German Enigma machine) Tj

T* (   In January 1990, Electron turned his attention to getting Zardoz.) Tj
T* (   After carefully reviewing an old copy of Zardoz, he had discovered a) Tj
T* (   system admin in Melbourne on the list. The subscriber could well have) Tj
T* (   the entire Zardoz archive on his machine, and that machine was so) Tj
T* (   close--less than half an hour's drive from Electron's home. All) Tj
T* (   Electron had to do was to break into the CSIRO.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, or) Tj
T* (   CSIRO, is a government owned and operated research body with many) Tj
T* (   offices around Australia. Electron only wanted to get into one: the) Tj
T* (   Division of Information Technology at 55 Barry Street, Carlton, just) Tj
T* (   around the corner from the University of Melbourne.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Rummaging through a Melbourne University computer, Electron had) Tj
T* (   already found one copy of the Zardoz archive, belonging to a system) Tj
T* (   admin. He gathered it up and quietly began downloading it to his) Tj
T* (   computer, but as his machine slowly siphoned off the Zardoz copy, his) Tj
T* (   link to the university abruptly went dead. The admin had discovered) Tj
T* (   the hacker and quickly killed the connection. All of which left) Tj
T* (   Electron back at square one--until he found another copy of Zardoz on) Tj
T* (   the CSIRO machine.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was nearly 3 a.m. on 1 February 1990, but Electron wasn't tired.) Tj
T* (   His head was buzzing. He had just successfully penetrated an account) Tj
T* (   called Worsley on the CSIRO computer called) Tj
T* (   DITMELA, using the sendmail bug. Electron assumed) Tj
T* (   DITMELA stood for Division of Information Technology, Melbourne,) Tj
T* (   computer `A'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron began sifting through Andrew Worsley's directories that day.) Tj
T* (   He knew Zardoz was in there somewhere, since he had seen it before.) Tj
T* (   After probing the computer, experimenting with different security) Tj
T* (   holes hoping one would let him inside, Electron managed to slip in) Tj
T* (   unnoticed. It was mid-afternoon, a bad time to hack a computer since) Tj
T* (   someone at work would likely spot the intruder before long. So) Tj
T* (   Electron told himself this was just a reconnaissance mission. Find out) Tj
T* (   if Zardoz was on the machine, then get out of there fast and come back) Tj
T* (   later--preferably in the middle of the night--to pull Zardoz out.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When he found a complete collection of Zardoz in Worsley's directory,) Tj
T* (   Electron was tempted to try a grab and run. The problem was that, with) Tj
T* (   his slow modem, he couldn't run very quickly. Downloading Zardoz would) Tj
T* (   take several hours. Quashing his overwhelming desire to reach out and) Tj
T* (   grab Zardoz then and there, he slipped out of the machine noiselessly.) Tj

T* (   Early next morning, an excited and impatient Electron crept back into) Tj
T* (   DITMELA and headed straight for Worsley's directory. Zardoz was still) Tj
T* (   there. And a sweet irony. Electron was using a security bug he had) Tj
T* (   found on an early issue of Zardoz to break into the computer which) Tj
T* (   would surrender the entire archive to him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Getting Zardoz out of the CSIRO machine was going to be a little) Tj
T* (   difficult. It was a big archive and at 300 baud--30 characters per) Tj
T* (   second--Electron's modem would take five hours to siphon off an entire) Tj
T* (   copy. Using the CAT command, Electron made copies of all the Zardoz) Tj
T* (   issues and bundled them up into one 500 k file. He called the new file) Tj
T* (   .t and stored it in the temporary directory on DITMELA.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then he considered what to do next. He would mail the Zardoz bundle to) Tj
T* (   another account outside the CSIRO computer, for safe-keeping. But) Tj
T* (   after that he had to make a choice: try to download the thing himself) Tj
T* (   or hang up, call Phoenix and ask him to download it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Using his 2400 baud modem, Phoenix would be able to download the) Tj
T* (   Zardoz bundle eight times faster than Electron could. On the other) Tj
T* (   hand, Electron didn't particularly want to give Phoenix access to the) Tj
T* (   CSIRO machine. They had both been targeting the machine, but he hadn't) Tj
T* (   told Phoenix that he had actually managed to get in. It wasn't that he) Tj
T* (   planned on withholding Zardoz when he got it. Quite the contrary,) Tj
T* (   Electron wanted Phoenix to read the security file so they could bounce) Tj
T* (   ideas off each other. When it came to accounts, however, Phoenix had a) Tj
T* (   way of messing things up. He talked too much. He was simply not) Tj
T* (   discreet.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   While Electron considered his decision, his fingers kept working at) Tj
T* (   the keyboard. He typed quickly, mailing copies of the Zardoz bundle to) Tj
T* (   two hacked student accounts at Melbourne University. With the) Tj
T* (   passwords to both accounts, he could get in whenever he wanted and he) Tj
T* (   wasn't taking any chances with this precious cargo. Two accounts were) Tj
T* (   safer than one--a main account and a back-up in case someone changed) Tj
T* (   the password on the first one.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then, as the DITMELA machine was still in the process of mailing the) Tj
T* (   Zardoz bundle off to the back-up sites, Electron's connection suddenly) Tj
T* (   died.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The CSIRO machine had hung up on him, which probably meant one thing.) Tj
T* (   The admin had logged him off. Electron was furious. What the hell was) Tj
T* (   a system administrator doing on a computer at this hour? The admin was) Tj
T* (   supposed to be asleep! That's why Electron logged on when he did. He) Tj
T* (   had seen Zardoz on the CSIRO machine the day before but he had been so) Tj
T* (   patient refusing to touch it because the risk of discovery was too) Tj
T* (   great. And now this.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The only hope was to call Phoenix and get him to login to the) Tj
T* (   Melbourne Uni accounts to see if the mail had arrived safely. If so,) Tj
T* (   he could download it with his faster modem before the CSIRO admin had) Tj
T* (   time to warn the Melbourne Uni admin, who would change the passwords.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron got on the phone to Phoenix. They had long since stopped) Tj
T* (   caring about what time of day they rang each other. 10 p.m. 2 a.m.) Tj
T* (   4.15 a.m. 6.45 a.m.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yeah.' Electron greeted Phoenix in the usual way.) Tj

T* (   `Yup,' Phoenix responded.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron told Phoenix what happened and gave him the two accounts at) Tj
T* (   Melbourne University where he had mailed the Zardoz bundle.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix hung up and rang back a few minutes later. Both accounts were) Tj
T* (   dead. Someone from Melbourne University had gone in and changed the) Tj
T* (   passwords within 30 minutes of Electron being booted off the CSIRO) Tj
T* (   computer. Both hackers were disturbed by the implications of this) Tj
T* (   event. It meant someone--in fact probably several people--were onto) Tj
T* (   them. But their desperation to get Zardoz overcame their fear.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron had one more account on the CSIRO computer. He didn't want to) Tj
T* (   give it to Phoenix, but he didn't have a choice. Still, the whole) Tj
T* (   venture was filled with uncertainty. Who knew if the Zardoz bundle was) Tj
T* (   still there? Surely an admin who bothered to kick Electron out would) Tj
T* (   move Zardoz to somewhere inaccessible. There was, however, a single) Tj
T* (   chance.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Electron read off the password and username, he told Phoenix to) Tj
T* (   copy the Zardoz bundle to a few other machines on the Internet instead) Tj
T* (   of trying to download it to his own computer. It would be much) Tj
T* (   quicker, and the CSIRO admin wouldn't dare break into someone else's) Tj
T* (   computers to delete the copied file. Choosing overseas sites would) Tj
T* (   make it even harder for the admin to reach the admins of those) Tj
T* (   machines and warn them in time. Then, once Zardoz was safely tucked) Tj
T* (   away in a few back-up sites, Phoenix could download it over the) Tj
T* (   Internet from one of those with less risk of being booted off the) Tj
T* (   machine halfway through the process.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Sitting at his home in Kelvin Grove, Thornbury, just two suburbs north) Tj
T* (   of the CSIRO machine, Ian Mathieson watched the hacker break into his) Tj
T* (   computer again. Awoken by a phone call at 2.30 a.m. telling him there) Tj
T* (   was a suspected hacker in his computer, Mathieson immediately logged) Tj
T* (   in to his work system, DITMELA, via his home computer and modem. The) Tj
T* (   call, from David Hornsby of the Melbourne University Computer Science) Tj
T* (   Department, was no false alarm.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After watching the unknown hacker, who had logged in through a) Tj
T* (   Melbourne University machine terminal server, for about twenty) Tj
T* (   minutes, Mathieson booted the hacker off his system. Afterwards he) Tj
T* (   noticed that the DITMELA computer was still trying to execute a) Tj
T* (   command issued by the hacker. He looked a little closer, and) Tj
T* (   discovered DITMELA was trying to deliver mail to two Melbourne) Tj
T* (   University accounts.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The mail, however, hadn't been completely delivered. It was still) Tj
T* (   sitting in the mail spool, a temporary holding pen for undelivered) Tj
T* (   mail. Curious as to what the hacker would want so much from his) Tj
T* (   system, Mathieson moved the file into a subdirectory to look at it. He) Tj
T* (   was horrified to find the entire Zardoz archive, and he knew exactly) Tj
T* (   what it meant. These were no ordinary hackers--they were precision) Tj
T* (   fliers. Fortunately, Mathieson) Tj
T* (   consoled himself, he had stopped the mail before it had been sent out) Tj
T* (   and secured it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Unfortunately, however, Mathieson had missed Electron's original) Tj
T* (   file--the bundle of Zardoz copies. When Electron had mailed the file,) Tj
T* (   he had copied it, leaving the original intact. They were still sitting) Tj
T* (   on DITMELA under the unassuming name .t. Mailing a file didn't delete) Tj

T* (   it--the computer only sent a copy of the original. Mathieson was an) Tj
T* (   intelligent man, a medical doctor with a master's degree in computer) Tj
T* (   science, but he had forgotten to check the temporary directory, one of) Tj
T* (   the few places a hacker could store files on a Unix system if he) Tj
T* (   didn't have root privileges.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   At exactly 3.30 a.m. Phoenix logged into DITMELA from the University) Tj
T* (   of Texas. He quickly looked in the temporary directory. The .t file) Tj
T* (   was there, just as Electron had said it would be. The hacker quickly) Tj
T* (   began transferring it back to the University of Texas.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He was feeling good. It looked like the Australians were going to get) Tj
T* (   the entire Zardoz collection after all. Everything was going extremely) Tj
T* (   well--until the transfer suddenly died. Phoenix had forgotten to check) Tj
T* (   that there was enough disk space available on the University of Texas) Tj

T* (   into a very hot machine, a machine where the admin could well be) Tj
T* (   watching his every move, he discovered there wasn't enough room for) Tj
T* (   the Zardoz file.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Aware that every second spent on-line to DITMELA posed a serious risk,) Tj
T* (   Phoenix logged off the CSIRO machine immediately. Still connected to) Tj
T* (   the Texas computer, he fiddled around with it, deleting other files) Tj
T* (   and making enough room to pull the whole 500 k Zardoz file across.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   At 3.37 a.m. Phoenix entered DITMELA again. This time, he vowed,) Tj
T* (   nothing would go wrong. He started up the file transfer and waited.) Tj
T* (   Less than ten minutes later, he logged off the CSIRO computer and) Tj
T* (   nervously checked the University of Texas system. It was there.) Tj
T* (   Zardoz, in all its glory. And it was his! Phoenix was ecstatic.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He wasn't done yet and there was no time for complacency. Swiftly, he) Tj
T* (   began compressing and encrypting Zardoz. He) Tj
T* (   compressed it because a smaller file was less obvious on the Texas) Tj
T* (   machine and was faster to send to a back-up machine. He encrypted it) Tj
T* (   so no-one nosing around the file would be able to see what was in it.) Tj
T* (   He wasn't just worried about system admins; the Texas system was) Tj
T* (   riddled with hackers, in part because it was home to his friend,) Tj
T* (   Legion of Doom hacker Erik Bloodaxe, a) Tj
T* (   student at the university.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After Phoenix was satisfied Zardoz was safe, he rang Electron just) Tj
T* (   before 4 a.m. with the good news. By 8.15, Phoenix had downloaded) Tj
T* (   Zardoz from the Texas computer onto his own machine. By 1.15 p.m.,) Tj
T* (   Electron had downloaded it from Phoenix's machine to his own.) Tj

T* (   Zardoz had been a difficult conquest, but Deszip would prove to be) Tj
T* (   even more so. While dozens of security experts possessed complete) Tj

T* (   guru, but also as an anti-hacker zealot. Spaf was based at Purdue) Tj
T* (   University, a hotbed of computer security experts. Bishop had earned) Tj
T* (   his PhD at Purdue and Dan Farmer was still there. Spaf was also one of) Tj
T* (   the founders of usenet, the Internet newsgroups service. While working) Tj
T* (   as a computer scientist at the university, he had made a name for) Tj
T* (   himself by, among other things, writing a technical analysis of the) Tj
T* (   RTM worm. The worm, authored by Cornell University student Robert T.) Tj
T* (   Morris Jr in 1988, proved to be a boon for Spaf's career.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Prior to the RTM worm, Spaf had been working in software engineering.) Tj
T* (   After the worm, he became a computer ethicist and a very public) Tj
T* (   spokesman for the conservatives in the computer security industry.) Tj
T* (   Spaf went on tour across the US, lecturing the public and the media on) Tj
T* (   worms, viruses and the ethics of hacking. During the Morris case,) Tj
T* (   hacking became a hot topic in the United States, and Spaf fed the) Tj
T* (   flames. When Judge Howard G. Munson refused to sentence Morris to) Tj
T* (   prison, instead ordering him to complete 400 hours community service,) Tj
T* (   pay a $10000 fine and submit to three years probation, Spaf publicly) Tj
T* (   railed against the decision. The media reported that he had called on) Tj
T* (   the computer industry to boycott any company which chose to employ) Tj
T* (   Robert T. Morris Jr.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Targeting Spaf therefore served a dual purpose for the Australian) Tj
T* (   hackers. He was undoubtedly a repository of treasures such as Deszip,) Tj
T* (   and he was also a tall poppy.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   One night, Electron and Phoenix decided to break into Spaf's machine) Tj
T* (   at Purdue to steal a copy of Deszip. Phoenix would do the actual) Tj
T* (   hacking, since he had the fast modem, but he would talk to Electron) Tj
T* (   simultaneously on the other phone line. Electron would guide him at) Tj
T* (   each step. That way, when Phoenix hit a snag, he wouldn't have to) Tj
T* (   retreat to regroup and risk discovery.) Tj

T* (   Both hackers had managed to break into another computer at Purdue,) Tj
T* (   called Medusa. But Spaf had a separate machine, Uther, which was) Tj
T* (   connected to Medusa.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix poked and prodded at Uther, trying to open a hole wide enough) Tj
T* (   for him to crawl through. At Electron's suggestion, he tried to use) Tj
T* (   the CHFN bug. The CHFN command lets users change the information) Tj
T* (   provided--such as their name, work address or office phone) Tj
T* (   number--when someone `fingers' their accounts. The bug had appeared in) Tj
T* (   one of the Zardoz files and Phoenix and Electron had already used it) Tj
T* (   to break into several other machines.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron wanted to use the CHFN bug because, if the attack was) Tj
T* (   successful, Phoenix would be able to make a root account for himself) Tj
T* (   on Spaf's machine. That would be the ultimate slap in the face to a) Tj
T* (   high-profile computer security guru.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But things weren't going well for Phoenix. The frustrated Australian) Tj
T* (   hacker kept telling Electron that the bug should work, but it) Tj
T* (   wouldn't, and he couldn't figure out why. The problem, Electron) Tj
T* (   finally concluded, was that Spaf's machine was a Sequent. The CHFN bug) Tj
T* (   depended on a particular Unix password file structure, but Sequents) Tj
T* (   used a different structure. It didn't help that Phoenix didn't know) Tj
T* (   that much about Sequents--they were one of Gandalf's specialties.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After a few exasperating hours struggling to make the CHFN bug work,) Tj
T* (   Phoenix gave up and turned to another security flaw suggested by) Tj
T* (   Electron: the FTP bug. Phoenix ran through the bug in his mind.) Tj
T* (   Normally, someone used FTP, or file transfer protocol, to transfer) Tj
T* (   files over a network, such as the Internet, from one computer to) Tj
T* (   another. FTPing to another machine was a bit like telnetting, but the) Tj
T* (   user didn't need a password to login and the commands he could execute) Tj
T* (   once in the other computer were usually very limited.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   If it worked, the FTP bug would allow Phoenix to slip in an extra) Tj
T* (   command during the FTP login process. That command would force Spaf's) Tj
T* (   machine to allow Phoenix to login as anyone he wanted--and what he) Tj
T* (   wanted was to login as someone who had root privileges. The `root') Tj
T* (   account might be a little obvious) Tj
T* (   if anyone was watching, and it didn't always have remote) Tj
T* (   access anyway. So he chose `daemon', another commonly root-privileged) Tj
T* (   account, instead.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was a shot in the dark. Phoenix was fairly sure Spaf would have) Tj
T* (   secured his machine against such an obvious attack, but Electron urged) Tj
T* (   him to give it a try anyway. The FTP bug had been announced throughout) Tj
T* (   the computer security community long ago, appearing in an early issue) Tj
T* (   of Zardoz. Phoenix hesitated, but he had run out of ideas, and time.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix typed:) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   FTP -i uther.purdue.edu) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   quote user anonymous) Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   home in Melbourne and race deep into the Midwest felt like a lifetime.) Tj
T* (   He wanted Spaf's machine, wanted Deszip, and wanted this attack to) Tj
T* (   work. If he could just get Deszip, he felt the Australians would be) Tj
T* (   unstoppable.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Spaf's machine opened its door as politely as a doorman at the Ritz) Tj
T* (   Carlton. Phoenix smiled at his computer. He was in.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was like being in Aladdin's cave. Phoenix just sat there, stunned) Tj
T* (   at the bounty which lay before him. It was his, all his. Spaf had) Tj
T* (   megabytes of security files in his directories. Source code for the) Tj
T* (   RTM Internet worm. Source code for the WANK worm. Everything. Phoenix) Tj
T* (   wanted to plunge his hands in each treasure chest and scoop out greedy) Tj
T* (   handfuls, but he resisted the urge. He had a more important--a more) Tj
T* (   strategic--mission to accomplish first.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He prowled through the directories, hunting everywhere for Deszip.) Tj
T* (   Like a burglar scouring the house for the family silver, he pawed) Tj
T* (   through directory after directory. Surely, Spaf had to have Deszip. If) Tj
T* (   anyone besides Matthew Bishop was going to have a copy, he would. And) Tj
T* (   finally, there it was. Deszip. Just waiting for Phoenix.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then Phoenix noticed something else. Another file. Curiosity got the) Tj
T* (   better of him and he zoomed in to have a quick look. This one) Tj
T* (   contained a passphrase--the passphrase. The phrase the Australians) Tj
T* (   needed to decrypt the original copy of Deszip they had stolen from the) Tj
T* (   Bear computer at Dartmouth three months earlier. Phoenix couldn't) Tj
T* (   believe the passphrase. It was so simple, so obvious. But he caught) Tj
T* (   himself. This was no time to cry over spilled milk. He had to get) Tj
T* (   Deszip out of the machine quickly, before anyone noticed he was there.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But as Phoenix began typing in commands, his screen appeared to freeze) Tj
T* (   up. He checked. It wasn't his computer. Something was wrong at the) Tj
T* (   other end. He was still logged into Spaf's machine. The connection) Tj
T* (   hadn't been killed. But when he typed commands, the computer in West) Tj
T* (   Lafayette, Indiana, didn't respond. Spaf's machine just sat there,) Tj
T* (   deaf and dumb.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix stared at his computer, trying to figure out what was) Tj
T* (   happening. Why wouldn't Spaf's machine answer? There were two) Tj
T* (   possibilities. Either the network--the connection between the first) Tj
T* (   machine he penetrated at Purdue and Spaf's own machine--had gone down) Tj
T* (   accidentally. Or someone had pulled the plug.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Why pull the plug? If they knew he was in there, why not just kick him) Tj
T* (   out of the machine? Better still, why not kick him out of Purdue all) Tj
T* (   together? Maybe they wanted to keep him on-line to trace which machine) Tj
T* (   he was coming from, eventually winding backwards from system to) Tj
T* (   system, following his trail.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix was in a dilemma. If the connection had crashed by accident,) Tj
T* (   he wanted to stay put and wait for the network to come back up again.) Tj
T* (   The FTP hole in Spaf's machine was an incredible piece of luck.) Tj
T* (   Chances were that someone would find) Tj
T* (   evidence of his break-in after he left and plug it. On the) Tj
T* (   other hand, he didn't want the people at Purdue tracing his) Tj
T* (   connections.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He waited a few more minutes, trying to hedge his bets. Feeling nervy) Tj
T* (   as the extended silence emanating from Spaf's machine wore on, Phoenix) Tj

T* (   decided to jump. With the lost treasures of Aladdin's cave fading in) Tj
T* (   his mind's eye like a mirage, Phoenix killed his connection.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron and Phoenix talked on the phone, moodily contemplating their) Tj
T* (   losses. It was a blow, but Electron reminded himself that getting) Tj
T* (   Deszip was never going to be easy. At least they had the passphrase to) Tj
T* (   unlock the encrypted Deszip taken from Dartmouth.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Soon, however, they discovered a problem. There had to be one,) Tj
T* (   Electron thought. They couldn't just have something go off without a) Tj
T* (   hitch for a change. That would be too easy. The problem this time was) Tj
T* (   that when they went searching for their copy from Dartmouth, which had) Tj
T* (   been stored several months before, it had vanished. The Dartmouth) Tj
T* (   system admin must have deleted it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was maddening. The frustration was unbearable. Each time they had) Tj
T* (   Deszip just within their grasp, it slipped away and) Tj
T* (   disappeared. Yet each time they lost their grip, it only deepened) Tj
T* (   their desire to capture the elusive prize. Deszip was fast becoming an) Tj
T* (   all-consuming obsession for Phoenix and Electron.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Their one last hope was the second copy of the encrypted Dartmouth) Tj
T* (   Deszip file they had given to Gandalf, but that hope did not burn) Tj
T* (   brightly. After all, if the Australians' copy had been deleted, there) Tj
T* (   was every likelihood that the Brit's copy had suffered the same fate.) Tj
T* (   Gandalf's copy hadn't been stored on his own computer. He had put it) Tj
T* (   on some dark corner of a machine in Britain.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron and Phoenix logged onto Altos and waited for Pad or Gandalf) Tj
T* (   to show up.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix typed .s for a list of who was on-line. He saw that Pad was) Tj
T* (   logged on:) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   No Chan User) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   0 Guest) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   1 Phoenix) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   2 Pad) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Guest 0 was Electron. He usually logged on as Guest, partly because he) Tj
T* (   was so paranoid about being busted and because he believed operators) Tj
T* (   monitored his connections if they knew it was Electron logging in.) Tj
T* (   They seemed to take great joy in sniffing the password to his own) Tj
T* (   account on Altos. Then, when he had logged off, they logged in and) Tj
T* (   changed his password so he couldn't get back under the name Electron.) Tj
T* (   Nothing was more annoying. Phoenix typed, `Hey, Pad. How's it going?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad wrote back, `Feeny! Heya.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Do you and Gand still have that encrypted copy of Deszip we gave you) Tj
T* (   a few months ago?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Encrypted copy ... hmm. Thinking.' Pad paused. He and Gandalf hacked) Tj
T* (   dozens of computer systems regularly. Sometimes it was difficult to) Tj
T* (   recall just where they had stored things.) Tj

T* (   JANET,' Pad said. Britain's Joint Academic Network was the equivalent) Tj
T* (   of Australia's AARNET, an early Internet based largely on a backbone) Tj
T* (   of universities and research centres.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I can't remember which system it was on,' Pad continued.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   If the Brits couldn't recall the institution, let alone the machine) Tj
T* (   where they had hidden Deszip, it was time to give up) Tj
T* (   all hope. JANET comprised hundreds, maybe thousands, of machines. It) Tj
T* (   was far too big a place to randomly hunt around for a file which) Tj
T* (   Gandalf would no doubt have tried to disguise in the first place.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `But the file was encrypted, and you didn't have the password,' Pad) Tj
T* (   wrote. `How come you want it?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Because we found the password. <smile>' That was the) Tj
T* (   etiquette on Altos. If you wanted to suggest an action, you put it in) Tj
T* (   < >.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Gr8!' Pad answered.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   That was Pad and Gandalf's on-line style. The number eight was the) Tj
T* (   British hackers' hallmark, since their group was called 8lgm, and they) Tj
T* (   used it instead of letters. Words like `great', `mate' and `later') Tj
T* (   became `gr8', `m8' and `l8r'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When people logged into Altos they could name a `place' of origin for) Tj
T* (   others to see. Of course, if you were logging from a country which had) Tj
T* (   laws against hacking, you wouldn't give your real country. You'd just) Tj
T* (   pick a place at random. Some people logged in from places like) Tj
T* (   Argentina, or Israel. Pad and Gandalf logged in from 8lgm.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I'll try to find Gandalf and ask him if he knows where we stashed the) Tj
T* (   copy,' Pad wrote to Phoenix.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Good. Thanks.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   While Phoenix and Electron waited on-line for Pad to return, Par) Tj
T* (   showed up on-line and joined their conversation. Par didn't know who) Tj
T* (   Guest 0 was, but Guest certainly knew who Par was. Time hadn't healed) Tj
T* (   Electron's old wounds when it came to Par. Electron didn't really) Tj
T* (   admit to himself the bad blood was still there over Theorem. He told) Tj
T* (   himself that he couldn't be bothered with Par, that Par was just a) Tj
T* (   phreaker, not a real hacker, that Par was lame.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix typed, `Hey, Par. How's it going?') Tj

T* (   `Feenster!' Par replied. `What's happening?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Lots and lots.') Tj

T* (   discuss private things with someone who might be a security guy) Tj
T* (   hanging around the chat channel like a bad smell.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Guest, do you have a name?' Par asked.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Any other names besides dickhead that is?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron sent a `whisper'--a private message--to Phoenix telling him) Tj

T* (   laughing to himself, halfway across the world from Par. Well, he) Tj
T* (   thought, that ought to freak out Par a bit. Nothing like a subtle hint) Tj
T* (   at law enforcement to drive him nuts.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Did you see THAT?' Par whispered to Phoenix. `UnderFED. What did he) Tj
T* (   mean?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I dunno,' Phoenix whispered back. Then he forwarded a copy of Par's) Tj
T* (   private message on to Electron. He knew it would make him laugh.) Tj

T* (   Electron but Guest 0 didn't answer.) Tj

T* (   Sitting at his terminal, on the other side of Melbourne from Electron,) Tj
T* (   Phoenix was also laughing. He liked Par, but the American was an easy) Tj

T* (   US, and Electron knew just the right buttons to push.) Tj

T* (   `I hope we get it,' Pad chipped in. `Would be gr8!') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Gr8 indeed. Feen, you've got the key to the encryption?' Gandalf) Tj
T* (   asked.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yeah.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `How many characters is it?' It was Gandalf's subtle way of asking for) Tj
T* (   the key itself.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix wasn't sure what to do. He wanted to give the British hackers) Tj
T* (   the key, but he was torn. He needed Pad and Gandalf's help to get the) Tj
T* (   copy of Deszip, if it was still around. But he knew Electron was) Tj
T* (   watching the conversation, and Electron was always so paranoid. He) Tj
T* (   disliked giving out any information, let alone giving it over Altos,) Tj
T* (   where the conversations were possibly logged by security people.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Should I give him the key?' Phoenix whispered to Electron.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Gandalf was waiting. To fend him off, Phoenix said, `It's 9 chars.') Tj
T* (   Chars was short for characters. On Altos the rule was to abbreviate) Tj
T* (   where ever possible.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `What is the first char?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yeah. Tell him,' Electron whispered to Phoenix.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Well, the key is ...') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `You're going to spew when you find out, Gand,' Electron interrupted.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yes ... go on,' Gandalf said. `I am listening.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `You won't believe it. <spew spew spew> The key is ... Dartmouth.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `WHAT???? WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' Gandalf exclaimed.) Tj
T* (   `No!!! IT's NOT TRUE! Bollox! You are KIDDING?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The British hacker was thumping himself on the head. The name of the) Tj
T* (   frigging university! What a stupid password!) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix gave an on-line chuckle. `Hehe. Yeah. So hard to guess. We) Tj
T* (   could have had Deszip for all these months ...') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Jesus. I hope it's still on that JANET system,' Gandalf said. Now) Tj
T* (   that he actually had the password, finding the file became even more) Tj
T* (   urgent.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Pray. Pray. Pray,' Phoenix said. `Yeah, you should have seen the) Tj
T* (   licence text on Deszip--it was by NASA.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `You've seen it? You saw Deszip's source code?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No,' Phoenix answered. `When I went back to the BEAR machine to check) Tj
T* (   if Deszip was still there, the program was gone. But the licence) Tj
T* (   agreement and other stuff was there. Should have read the licence ...) Tj
T* (   truly amazing. It basically went on and on about how the people who) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Now. Fingers crossed, m8! See ya l8r ...' Then he was gone.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The waiting was driving Electron nuts. He kept thinking about Deszip,) Tj
T* (   about how he could have had it months and months ago. That program was) Tj
T* (   such a prize. He was salivating at the thought of getting it after all) Tj
T* (   this time pursuing it around the globe, chasing its trail from system) Tj
T* (   to system, never quite getting close enough to grab it.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `YES!' Electron added. `Have you decrypted it yet?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Not yet. Crypt isn't on that machine. We can either copy Crypt onto) Tj
T* (   that machine or copy the file onto another computer which already has) Tj
T* (   Crypt on it,' Gandalf said.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Let's move it. Quick ... quick ... this damn thing has a habit of) Tj
T* (   disappearing,' Electron said.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yeah, this is the last copy ... the only one I got.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `OK. Think ... think ... where can we copy it to?' Electron said.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Texas!' Gandalf wanted to copy it to a computer at the University of) Tj
T* (   Texas at Austin, home of the LOD hacker Erik Bloodaxe.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Irrepressible, Gandalf came on like a steam roller if he liked) Tj
T* (   you--and cut you down in a flash if he didn't. His rough-and-tumble) Tj
T* (   working-class humour particularly appealed to Electron. Gandalf seemed) Tj
T* (   able to zero in on the things which worried you most--something so) Tj
T* (   deep or serious it was often unsaid. Then he would blurt it out in) Tj
T* (   such crass, blunt terms you couldn't help laughing. It was his way of) Tj
T* (   being in your face in the friendliest possible manner.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yeah! Blame everything on Erik!' Phoenix joked. `No, seriously. That) Tj
T* (   place is crawling with security now, all after Erik. They are into) Tj
T* (   everything.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix had heard all about the security purge at the university from) Tj
T* (   Erik. The Australian called Erik all the time, mostly by charging the) Tj
T* (   calls to stolen AT&T cards. Erik hadn't been raided by the Secret) Tj
T* (   Service yet, but he had been tipped off and was expecting a visit any) Tj
T* (   day.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `It probably won't decrypt anyway,' Electron said.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Oh, phuck off!' Gandalf shot back. `Come on! I need a site NOW!') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Thinking ...' Phoenix said. `Gotta be some place with room--how big) Tj
T* (   is it?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   hurry up! How about a university?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Princeton, Yale could do either of those.' Electron suggested. `What) Tj
T* (   about MIT--you hacked an account there recently, Gand?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   All four hackers racked their minds for a safe haven. The world was) Tj
T* (   their oyster, as British and Australian hackers held a real-time) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `We only need somewhere to stash it for a little while, until we can) Tj

T* (   root. And it's got to have anon FTP.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anon FTP, or anonymous file transfer protocol, on a host machine would) Tj
T* (   allow Gandalf to shoot the file from his JANET machine across the) Tj
T* (   Internet into the host. Most importantly, Gandalf could do so without) Tj
T* (   an account on the target machine. He could simply login as) Tj
T* (   `anonymous', a method of access which had more limitations than simply) Tj
T* (   logging in with a normal account. He would, however, still be able to) Tj
T* (   upload the file.) Tj

T* (   `OK. OK, I have an idea,' Phoenix said. `Lemme go check) Tj
T* (   it out.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix dropped out of Altos and connected to the University of Texas.) Tj
T* (   The physical location of a site didn't matter. His head was spinning) Tj
T* (   and it was the only place he could think of. But he didn't try to) Tj
T* (   connect to Happy, the machine he often used which Erik had told him) Tj
T* (   about. He headed to one of the other university computers, called) Tj
T* (   Walt.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The network was overloaded. Phoenix was left dangling, waiting to) Tj
T* (   connect for minutes on end. The lines were congested. He logged back) Tj
T* (   into Altos and told Pad and Electron. Gandalf was nowhere to be seen.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Damn,' Electron said. Then, `OK, I might have an idea.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No, wait!' Phoenix cut in. `I just thought of a site! And I have root) Tj
T* (   too! But it's on NASA ...') Tj

T* (   `Oh that's OK. I'm sure they won't mind a bit. <grin>') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I'll go make sure it's still OK. Back in a bit,' Phoenix typed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix jumped out of Altos and headed toward NASA. He telnetted into) Tj
T* (   a NASA computer called CSAB at the Langley Research Center in Hampton,) Tj
T* (   Virginia. He had been in and out of NASA quite a few times and had) Tj
T* (   recently made himself a root account on CSAB. First, he had to check) Tj
T* (   the account was still alive, then he had to make sure the system) Tj
T* (   administrator wasn't logged in.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Whizzing past the official warning sign about unauthorised access in) Tj
T* (   US government computers on the login screen, Phoenix typed in his user) Tj
T* (   name and password.) Tj

T* (   Damn.) Tj

T* (   `Well?' Electron asked.) Tj

T* (   time. He had to find out if the computer had Crypt on it. It did.) Tj

T* (   was the damn thing?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Uh oh. Phoenix noticed the system administrator, Sharon Beskenis, was) Tj
T* (   still logged in. She was connected from Phoebe, another NASA machine.) Tj
T* (   There was only one other user besides himself logged into the CSAB) Tj
T* (   machine, someone called Carrie. As if that wasn't bad enough, Phoenix) Tj
T* (   realised his username stood out a like a sore thumb. If the admin) Tj
T* (   looked at who was on-line she would see herself, Carrie and a user) Tj
T* (   called `friend', an account he had created for himself. How many) Tj
T* (   legitimate accounts on NASA computers had that name?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Worse, Phoenix noticed that he had forgotten to cover his login trail.) Tj
T* (   `Friend' was telnetting into the NASA computer from the University of) Tj
T* (   Texas. No, no, he thought, that would definitely have to go. He) Tj
T* (   disconnected from NASA, bounced back to the university and then logged) Tj
T* (   in to NASA again. Good grief. Now the damn NASA machine showed two) Tj
T* (   people logged in as `friend'. The computer hadn't properly killed his) Tj
T* (   previous login. Stress.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix tried frantically to clear out his first login by killing its) Tj
T* (   process number. The NASA computer responded that there was no such) Tj
T* (   process number. Increasingly nervous, Phoenix figured he must have) Tj
T* (   typed in the wrong number. Unhinged, he grabbed one of the other) Tj
T* (   process numbers and killed that.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Christ! That was the admin's process number. Phoenix had just) Tj
T* (   disconnected Sharon from her own machine. Things were not going well.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Now he was under serious pressure. He didn't dare logout, because) Tj
T* (   Sharon would no doubt find his `friend' account, kill it and close up) Tj
T* (   the security hole he had originally used to get in. Even if she didn't) Tj
T* (   find Deszip on her own machine, he might not be able to get back in) Tj
T* (   again to retrieve it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After another frenzied minute hunting around the machine, Phoenix) Tj
T* (   finally unearthed Gandalf's copy of Deszip. Now, the moment of truth.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He tried the passphrase. It worked! All he had to do) Tj
T* (   was uncompress Deszip and get it out of there. He typed, `uncompress) Tj
T* (   deszip.tar.z', but he didn't like how the NASA computer answered his) Tj
T* (   command:) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   corrupt input) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Something was wrong, terribly wrong. The file appeared to be partially) Tj
T* (   destroyed. It was too painful a possibility to contemplate. Even if) Tj
T* (   only a small part of the main Deszip program had been damaged, none of) Tj
T* (   it would be useable.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Rubbing sweat from his palms, Phoenix hoped that maybe the file had) Tj
T* (   just been damaged as he attempted to uncompress it. He had kept the) Tj
T* (   original, so he went back to that and tried decrypting and) Tj
T* (   uncompressing it again. The NASA computer gave him the same ugly) Tj
T* (   response. Urgently, he tried yet again, but this time attempted to) Tj
T* (   uncompress the file in a different way. Same problem.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix was at his wits' end. This was too much. The most he could) Tj
T* (   hope was that the file had somehow become corrupted in the transfer) Tj
T* (   from Gandalf's JANET machine. He logged out of NASA and returned to) Tj
T* (   Altos. The other three were waiting impatiently for him.) Tj

T* (   Eugene Spafford was the kind of computer security expert who loses a) Tj
T* (   lot of face when a hacker gets into his machine, and a wounded bull is) Tj
T* (   a dangerous enemy.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The security people had been able to connect and link up a series of) Tj
T* (   break-ins with the hacker who called himself Phoenix because his style) Tj
T* (   was so distinctive. For example, whenever he was creating a root) Tj
T* (   shell--root access--for himself, he would always save it in the same) Tj
T* (   filename and in the same location on the) Tj
T* (   computer. In some instances, he even created accounts called `Phoenix') Tj
T* (   for himself. It was this consistency of style which had made things so) Tj
T* (   much easier for admins to trace his movements.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In his typical understated fashion, Pad suggested a change of style.) Tj
T* (   And maybe, he added, it wasn't such a bad idea for the Australians to) Tj
T* (   tone down their activities a bit. The undercurrent of the message was) Tj
T* (   serious.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `They said that some security people had contacted Australian law) Tj
T* (   enforcement, who were supposed to be "dealing with it",' Pad said.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Do they know my real name?' Phoenix asked, worried. Electron was also) Tj
T* (   watching this conversation with some concern.) Tj

T* (   `Don't know. Got it from Shatter. He's not always reliable,) Tj
T* (   but ...') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad was trying to soften the news by playing down Shatter's importance) Tj
T* (   as a source. He didn't trust his fellow British hacker but Shatter had) Tj
T* (   some good, if mysterious, connections. An enigmatic figure who seemed) Tj
T* (   to keep one foot in the computer underworld and the other in the) Tj
T* (   upright computer security industry, Shatter leaked information to Pad) Tj
T* (   and Gandalf, and occasionally to the Australians.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   While the two British hackers sometimes discounted Shatter's advice,) Tj
T* (   they also took the time to talk to him. Once, Electron had intercepted) Tj
T* (   email showing Pengo had turned to Shatter for advice about his) Tj
T* (   situation after the raid in Germany. With some spare time prior to his) Tj
T* (   trial, Pengo asked Shatter whether it was safe to travel to the US on) Tj
T* (   a summer holiday in 1989. Shatter asked for Pengo's birthdate and) Tj
T* (   other details. Then he returned with an unequivocal answer: Under no) Tj
T* (   circumstances was Pengo to travel to the US.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Subsequently, it was reported that officials in the US Justice) Tj
T* (   Department had been examining ways to secretly coax Pengo onto) Tj
T* (   American soil, where they could seize him. They would then force him) Tj
T* (   to face trial in their own courts.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Had Shatter known this? Or had he just told Pengo not to go to the US) Tj
T* (   because it was good commonsense? No-one was quite sure, but people) Tj
T* (   took note of what Shatter told them.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Shatter definitely got the info right about Spaf's machine. 100%) Tj
T* (   right,' Pad continued. `He knew exactly how you hacked it. I couldn't) Tj
T* (   believe it. Be careful if you're still hacking m8, especially on the) Tj
T* (   Inet.' The `Inet' was shorthand for the Internet.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The Altos hackers went quiet.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `It's not just you,' Pad tried to reassure the Australians. `Two) Tj
T* (   security people from the US are coming to the UK to try and find out) Tj
T* (   something about someone named Gandalf. Oh, and Gand's mate, who might) Tj
T* (   be called Patrick.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad had indeed based his handle on the name Patrick, or Paddy, but) Tj
T* (   that wasn't his real name. No intelligent hacker would use his real) Tj
T* (   name for his handle. Paddy was the name of one of his favourite) Tj
T* (   university lecturers, an Irishman who laughed a good deal. Like Par's) Tj
T* (   name, Pad's handle had coincidentally echoed a second meaning when the) Tj
T* (   British hacker moved into exploring X.25 networks. An X.25 PAD is a) Tj
T* (   packet assembler disassembler, the interface between the X.25 network) Tj
T* (   and a modem or terminal server. Similarly, Gandalf, while being first) Tj
T* (   and foremost the wizard from The Lord of The Rings, also happened to) Tj
T* (   be a terminal server brand name.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Despite the gravity of the news that the security community was) Tj
T* (   closing the net around them, none of the hackers lost their wicked) Tj
T* (   sense of humour.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `You know,' Pad went on, `Spaf was out of the country when his machine) Tj
T* (   got hacked.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Was he? Where?' asked Gandalf, who had just joined the conversation.) Tj

T* (   `In Europe.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron couldn't resist. `Where was Spaf, Gandalf asks as he hears a) Tj
T* (   knock on his door ...') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Haha,' Gandalf laughed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `<knock> <knock>' Electron went on, hamming it up.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Oh! Hello there, Mr Spafford,' Gandalf typed, playing along.) Tj

T* (   `Hello, I'm Gene and I'm mean!') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Alone in their separate homes on different corners of the globe, the) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Well, Mr Spafford, it seems you're a right fucking idiot for not) Tj
T* (   patching your FTP!' Gandalf proclaimed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Not to mention the CHFN bug--saved by a Sequent! Or you'd be very) Tj
T* (   fucking embarrassed,' Phoenix added.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix was laughing too, but he was a little nervous about Pad's) Tj
T* (   warning and he turned the conversation back to a serious note.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `So, Pad, what else did Shatter tell you?' Phoenix asked) Tj
T* (   anxiously.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Not much. Except that some of the security investigations might be) Tj
T* (   partly because of UCB.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   UCB was the University of California at Berkeley. Phoenix had been) Tj
T* (   visiting machines at both Berkeley and LLNL so much recently that the) Tj
T* (   admins seemed to have not only noticed him, but they had pinpointed) Tj
T* (   his handle. One day he had telnetted into dewey.soe.berkeley.edu--the) Tj
T* (   Dewey machine as it was known--and had been startled to find the) Tj
T* (   following message of the day staring him in the face:) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix,) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Get out of Dewey NOW!) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Also, do not use any of the `soe' machines.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Thank you,) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Daniel Berger) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix did a double take when he saw this public warning. Having been) Tj
T* (   in and out of the system so many times, he just zoomed past the words) Tj
T* (   on the login screen. Then, in a delayed reaction, he realised the) Tj
T* (   login message was addressed to him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Ignoring the warning, he proceeded to get root on the Berkeley machine) Tj
T* (   and look through Berger's files. Then he sat back, thinking about the) Tj
T* (   best way to deal with the problem. Finally, he decided to send the) Tj
T* (   admin a note saying he was leaving the system for good.) Tj

T* (   Within days, Phoenix was back in the Dewey machine, weaving in and out) Tj
T* (   of it as if nothing had happened. After all, he had broken into the) Tj
T* (   system, and managed to get root through his own wit. He had earned the) Tj
T* (   right to be in the computer. He might send the admin a note to put him) Tj
T* (   at ease, but Phoenix wasn't going to give up accessing Berkeley's) Tj
T* (   computers just because it upset Daniel Berger.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `See,' Pad continued, `I think the UCB people kept stuff on their) Tj
T* (   systems that wasn't supposed to be there. Secret things.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Classified military material wasn't supposed to be stored) Tj
T* (   on non-classified network computers. However, Pad guessed that) Tj
T* (   sometimes researchers broke rules and took short cuts because they) Tj
T* (   were busy thinking about their research and not the security) Tj
T* (   implications.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Some of the stuff might have been illegal,' Pad told his captive) Tj
T* (   audience. `And then they find out some of you guys have been in there) Tj
T* (   ...') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Shit,' Phoenix said.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `So, well, if it APPEARED like someone was inside trying to get at) Tj
T* (   those secrets ...' Pad paused. `Then you can guess what happened. It) Tj
T* (   seems they really want to get whoever was inside their machines.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   There was momentary silence while the other hackers digested all that) Tj
T* (   Pad had told them. As a personality on Altos, Pad remained ever so) Tj
T* (   slightly withdrawn from the other hackers, even the Australians whom) Tj
T* (   he considered mates. This reserved quality gave his warning a certain) Tj
T* (   sobriety, which seeped into the very fabric of Altos that day.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Eventually, Electron responded to Pad's warning by typing a comment) Tj
T* (   directed at Phoenix: `I told you talking to security guys is nothing) Tj
T* (   but trouble.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It irritated Electron more and more that Phoenix felt compelled to) Tj
T* (   talk to white hats in the security industry. In Electron's view,) Tj
T* (   drawing attention to yourself was just a bad idea all around and he) Tj
T* (   was increasingly annoyed at watching Phoenix feed his ego. He had made) Tj
T* (   veiled references to Phoenix's bragging on Altos many times, saying) Tj
T* (   things like `I wish people wouldn't talk to security guys'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix responded to Electron on-line somewhat piously. `Well, I will) Tj
T* (   never talk to security guys seriously again.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron had heard it all before. It was like listening to an) Tj
T* (   alcoholic swear he would never touch another drink. Bidding the others) Tj
T* (   goodbye, Electron logged off. He didn't care to listen to Phoenix any) Tj
T* (   more.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Others did, however. Hundreds of kilometres away, in a special room) Tj
T* (   secreted away inside a bland building in Canberra, Sergeant Michael) Tj
T* (   Costello and Constable William Apro had been methodically capturing) Tj
T* (   each and every electronic boast as it poured from Phoenix's phone. The) Tj
T* (   two officers recorded the data transmissions passing in and out of his) Tj
T* (   computer. They then played this recording into their own modem and) Tj

T* (   Both police officers had travelled north from Melbourne, where they) Tj
T* (   worked with the AFP's Computer Crime Unit. Settling into their) Tj
T* (   temporary desks with their PC and laptop, the officers began their) Tj
T* (   secret eavesdropping work on 1 February 1990.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was the first time the AFP had done a datatap. They were happy to) Tj
T* (   bide their time, to methodically record Phoenix hacking into Berkeley,) Tj
T* (   into Texas, into NASA, into a dozen computers around the world. The) Tj
T* (   phone tap warrant was good for 60 days, which was more than enough) Tj
T* (   time to secrete away a mountain of damning evidence against the) Tj
T* (   egotistical Realm hacker. Time was on their side.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The officers worked the Operation Dabble job in shifts. Constable Apro) Tj
T* (   arrived at the Telecommunications Intelligence Branch of the AFP at 8) Tj
T* (   p.m. Precisely ten hours later, at 6 the next morning, Sergeant) Tj
T* (   Costello relieved Apro, who knocked off for a good sleep. Apro) Tj
T* (   returned again at 8 p.m. to begin the night shift.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   They were there all the time. Twenty-four hours a day. Seven days a) Tj
T* (   week. Waiting and listening.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was too funny. Erik Bloodaxe in Austin, Texas, couldn't stop) Tj
T* (   laughing. In Melbourne, Phoenix's side hurt from laughing so much.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix loved to talk on the phone. He often called Erik, sometimes) Tj
T* (   every day, and they spoke for ages. Phoenix didn't worry about cost;) Tj
T* (   he wasn't paying for it. The call would appear on some poor sod's bill) Tj
T* (   and he could sort it out with the phone company.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Sometimes Erik worried a little about whether Phoenix wasn't going to) Tj
T* (   get himself in a jam making all these international calls. Not that he) Tj
T* (   didn't like talking to the Australian; it was a hoot. Still, the) Tj
T* (   concern sat there, unsettled, in the back of his mind. A few times he) Tj
T* (   asked Phoenix about it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No prob. Hey, AT&T isn't an Australian company,' Phoenix would say.) Tj
T* (   `They can't do anything to me.' And Erik had let it rest at that.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   For his part, Erik didn't dare call Phoenix, especially not since his) Tj
T* (   little visit from the US Secret Service. On 1 March 1990, they burst) Tj
T* (   into his home, with guns drawn, in a dawn raid. The agents searched) Tj
T* (   everywhere, tearing the student house apart, but they didn't find) Tj
T* (   anything incriminating. They did take Erik's $59 keyboard terminal) Tj
T* (   with its chintzy little 300 baud modem, but they didn't get his main) Tj
T* (   computer, because Erik knew they were coming.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The Secret Service had subpoenaed his academic records, and Erik had) Tj
T* (   heard about it before the raid. So when the Secret Service arrived,) Tj
T* (   Erik's stuff just wasn't there. It hadn't been there for a few weeks,) Tj
T* (   but for Erik, they had been hard weeks. The hacker found himself) Tj
T* (   suffering withdrawal symptoms, so he bought the cheapest home computer) Tj
T* (   and modem he could find to tide him over.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   That equipment was the only computer gear the Secret Service) Tj
T* (   discovered, and they were not happy special agents. But without) Tj
T* (   evidence, their hands were tied. No charges were laid.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Still, Erik thought he was probably being watched. The last thing he) Tj
T* (   wanted was for Phoenix's number to appear on his home phone bill. So) Tj

T* (   often talked for hours when Erik was working nights. It was a slack) Tj
T* (   job, just changing the back-up tapes on various computers and making) Tj
T* (   sure they didn't jam. Perfect for a student. It left Erik hours of) Tj
T* (   free time.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Erik frequently reminded Phoenix that his phone was probably tapped,) Tj
T* (   but Phoenix just laughed. `Yeah, well don't worry about it, mate. What) Tj
T* (   are they going to do? Come and get me?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After Erik put a hold on his own hacking activities, he lived) Tj
T* (   vicariously, listening to Phoenix's exploits. The Australian called) Tj
T* (   him with a technical problem or an interesting system, and then they) Tj
T* (   discussed various strategies for getting into the machine. However,) Tj
T* (   unlike Electron's talks with Phoenix, conversations with Erik weren't) Tj
T* (   only about hacking. They chatted about life, about what Australia was) Tj
T* (   like, about girls, about what was in the newspaper that day. It was) Tj
T* (   easy to talk to Erik. He had a big ego, like most hackers, but it was) Tj
T* (   inoffensive, largely couched in his self-effacing humour.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix often made Erik laugh. Like the time he got Clifford Stoll, an) Tj
T* (   astronomer, who wrote The Cuckoo's Egg. The book described his pursuit) Tj
T* (   of a German hacker who had broken into the computer system Stoll) Tj
T* (   managed at Lawrence Berkeley Labs near San Francisco. The hacker had) Tj
T* (   been part of the same hacking ring as Pengo. Stoll took a hard line on) Tj
T* (   hacking, a position which did not win him popularity in the) Tj
T* (   underground. Both Phoenix and Erik had read Stoll's book, and one day) Tj
T* (   they were sitting around chatting about it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `You know, it's really stupid that Cliffy put his email address in his) Tj
T* (   book,' Phoenix said. `Hmm, why don't I go check?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Sure enough, Phoenix called Erik back about a day later. `Well, I got) Tj
T* (   root on Cliffy's machine,' he began slowly, then he burst out) Tj
T* (   laughing. `And I changed the message of the day. Now it reads, "It) Tj
T* (   looks like the Cuckoo's got egg on his face"!') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was uproariously funny. Stoll, the most famous hacker-catcher in) Tj
T* (   the world, had been japed! It was the funniest thing Erik had heard in) Tj
T* (   weeks.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But it was not nearly so amusing as what Erik told Phoenix later about) Tj
T* (   the New York Times. The paper had published an article on 19 March) Tj
T* (   suggesting a hacker had written some sort of virus or worm which was) Tj
T* (   breaking into dozens of computers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Listen to this,' Erik had said, reading Phoenix the lead paragraph,) Tj
T* (   `"A computer intruder has written a program that has entered dozens of) Tj
T* (   computers in a nationwide network in recent weeks, automatically) Tj
T* (   stealing electronic documents containing users' passwords and erasing) Tj
T* (   files to help conceal itself."') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix was falling off his chair he was laughing so hard. A program?) Tj
T* (   Which was automatically doing this? No. It wasn't an automated) Tj
T* (   program, it was the Australians! It was the Realm hackers! God, this) Tj
T* (   was funny.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Wait--there's more! It says, "Another rogue program shows a) Tj
T* (   widespread vulnerability". I laughed my ass off,' Erik said,) Tj

T* (   `A rogue program! Who wrote the article?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `A John Markoff,' Erik answered, wiping his eyes. `I called him up.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `You did? What did you say?' Phoenix tried to gather himself together.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `"John," I said, "You know that article you wrote on page 12 of the) Tj
T* (   Times? It's wrong! There's no rogue program attacking the Internet.") Tj
T* (   He goes, "What is it then?" "It's not a virus or a worm," I said.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Erik started laughing uncontrollably again.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Then Markoff sounds really stunned, and he goes, "People?" And I) Tj
T* (   said, "Yeah, people." Then he said, "How do you know?" And I said,) Tj
T* (   "Because, John, I KNOW."') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix erupted in laughter again. The Times reporter obviously had) Tj
T* (   worms on his mind, since the author of the famous Internet worm,) Tj
T* (   Robert T. Morris Jr, had just been tried and convicted in the US. He) Tj
T* (   was due to be sentenced in May.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   US investigators had tracked the hacker's connections, looping through) Tj
T* (   site after site in a burrowing manner which they assumed belonged to a) Tj
T* (   worm. The idea of penetrating so many sites all in such a short time) Tj
T* (   clearly baffled the investigators, who concluded it must be a program) Tj
T* (   rather than human beings launching the attacks.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yeah,' Erik continued, `And then Markoff said, "Can you get me to) Tj
T* (   talk to them?" And I said I'd see what I could do.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yeah,' Phoenix said. `Go tell him, yes. Yeah, I gotta talk to this) Tj

T* (   `The man identified himself only as an Australian named Dave,' the) Tj

T* (   he'd used. Of course, he wasn't the only one using the name Dave. When) Tj
T* (   Erik first met the Australians on Altos, he marvelled at how they all) Tj
T* (   called themselves Dave. I'm Dave, he's Dave, we're all Dave, they told) Tj
T* (   him. It was just easier that way, they said.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   machines, and that the Smithsonian Astronomical Observatory at Harvard) Tj

T* (   known hacker-catcher, and he had smeared the insult across the front) Tj
T* (   page of the most prestigious newspaper in America.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   And Markoff reported that he had been in Spaf's system too! Phoenix) Tj
T* (   glowed happily. Better still, Markoff had quoted `Dave' on the) Tj
T* (   subject: `The caller said ... "It used to be the security guys chasing) Tj
T* (   the hackers. Now it's the hackers chasing the security people."') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The article went on: `Among the institutions believed to have been) Tj
T* (   penetrated by the intruder are the Los Alamos National Laboratories,) Tj
T* (   Harvard, Digital Equipment Corporation, Boston University and the) Tj
T* (   University of Texas.' Yes, that list sounded about right. Well, for) Tj
T* (   the Australians as a group anyway. Even if Phoenix hadn't masterminded) Tj
T* (   or even penetrated some of those himself, he was happy to take the) Tj
T* (   credit in the Times.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   This was a red-letter day for Phoenix.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron, however, was furious. How could Phoenix be so stupid? He) Tj
T* (   knew that Phoenix had an ego, that he talked too much, and that his) Tj
T* (   tendency to brag had grown worse over time, fed by the skyrocketing) Tj
T* (   success of the Australian hackers. Electron knew all of that, but he) Tj
T* (   still couldn't quite believe that Phoenix had gone so far as to strut) Tj
T* (   and preen like a show pony for the New York Times.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   To think that he had associated with Phoenix. Electron was disgusted.) Tj
T* (   He had never trusted Phoenix--a caution now proved wise. But he had) Tj
T* (   spent hours with him on the phone, with most of the information) Tj
T* (   flowing in one direction. But not only did Phoenix show no discretion) Tj
T* (   at all in dealing with the paper, he bragged about doing things that) Tj
T* (   Electron had done! If Phoenix had to talk--and clearly he should have) Tj
T* (   kept his mouth shut--he should have at least been honest about the) Tj
T* (   systems for which he could claim credit.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron had tried with Phoenix. Electron had suggested that he stop) Tj
T* (   talking to the security guys. He had continually urged caution and) Tj
T* (   discretion. He had even subtly withdrawn each time Phoenix suggested) Tj
T* (   one of his hair-brained schemes to show off to a security bigwig.) Tj
T* (   Electron had done this in the hope that Phoenix might get the hint.) Tj
T* (   Maybe, if Phoenix couldn't hear someone shouting advice at him, he) Tj
T* (   might at least listen to someone whispering it. But no. Phoenix was) Tj
T* (   far too thick for that.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The Internet--indeed, all hacking--was out of bounds for weeks, if not) Tj
T* (   months. There was no chance the Australian authorities would let a) Tj
T* (   front-page story in the Times go by un-heeded. The Americans would be) Tj
T* (   all over them. In one selfish act of hubris, Phoenix had ruined the) Tj
T* (   party for everyone else.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron unplugged his modem and took it to his father. During exams,) Tj
T* (   he had often asked his father to hide it. He didn't have the) Tj
T* (   self-discipline needed to stay away on his own and there was no other) Tj
T* (   way Electron could keep himself from jacking in--plugging his modem) Tj
T* (   into the wall. His father had become an expert at hiding the device,) Tj
T* (   but Electron usually still managed to find it after a few days,) Tj
T* (   tearing the house apart until he emerged, triumphant, with the modem) Tj
T* (   held high above his head. Even when his father began hiding the modem) Tj
T* (   outside the family home it would only postpone the inevitable.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   This time, however, Electron vowed he would stop hacking until the) Tj

T* (   fallout had cleared--he had to. So he handed the modem to his father,) Tj
T* (   with strict instructions, and then tried to distract himself by) Tj
T* (   cleaning up his hard drive and disks. His hacking files had to go too.) Tj
T* (   So much damning evidence of his activities. He deleted some files and) Tj
T* (   took others on disks to store at a friend's house. Deleting files) Tj
T* (   caused Electron considerable pain, but there was no other way. Phoenix) Tj
T* (   had backed him into a corner.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Brimming with excitement, Phoenix rang Electron on a sunny March) Tj
T* (   afternoon.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Guess what?' Phoenix was jumping around like an eager puppy at the) Tj
T* (   other end of the line. `We made the nightly news right across the US!') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Uhuh,' Electron responded, unimpressed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `This is not a joke!' We were on cable news all day too. I called Erik) Tj
T* (   and he told me.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Mmm,' Electron said.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `You know, we did a lot of things right. Like Harvard. We got into) Tj
T* (   every system at Harvard. It was a good move. Harvard gave us the fame) Tj
T* (   we needed.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron couldn't believe what he was hearing. He didn't need any) Tj
T* (   fame--and he certainly didn't need to be busted. The) Tj
T* (   conversation--like Phoenix himself--was really beginning to annoy him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Hey, and they know your name,' Phoenix said coyly.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   That got a reaction. Electron gulped his anger.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Haha! Just joshing!' Phoenix practically shouted. `Don't worry! They) Tj
T* (   didn't really mention anyone's name.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Good,' Electron answered curtly. His irritation stewed) Tj
T* (   quietly.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `So, do you reckon we'll make the cover of Time or Newsweek?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Good grief! Didn't Phoenix ever give up? As if it wasn't enough to) Tj
T* (   appear on the 6 o'clock national news in a country crawling with) Tj
T* (   over-zealous law enforcement agencies. Or to make the New York Times.) Tj
T* (   He had to have the weeklies too.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix was revelling in his own publicity. He felt like he was on top) Tj
T* (   of the world, and he wanted to shout about it. Electron had felt the) Tj
T* (   same wave of excitement from hacking many high-profile targets and) Tj
T* (   matching wits with the best, but he was happy to stand on the peak by) Tj
T* (   himself, or with people like Pad and Gandalf, and enjoy the view) Tj
T* (   quietly. He was happy to know he had been the best on the frontier of) Tj
T* (   a computer underground which was fresh, experimental and, most of all,) Tj
T* (   international. He didn't need to call up newspaper reporters or gloat) Tj
T* (   about it in Clifford Stoll's face.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Well, what do you reckon?' Phoenix asked impatiently.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No,' Electron answered.) Tj

T* (   `No? You don't think we will?' Phoenix sounded disappointed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Well, I'll demand it!' Phoenix said laughing, `Fuck it, we want the) Tj
T* (   cover of Newsweek, nothing less.' Then, more seriously, `I'm trying to) Tj
T* (   work out what really big target would clinch it for us.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yeah, OK, whatever,' Electron replied, distancing himself again.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But Electron was thinking, Phoenix, you are a fool. Didn't he see the) Tj
T* (   warning signs? Pad's warning, all the busts in the US, reports that) Tj
T* (   the Americans were hunting down the Brits. As a result of these news) Tj
T* (   reports of which Phoenix was so proud, bosses across the world would) Tj
T* (   be calling their computer managers into their offices and breathing) Tj
T* (   down their necks about their own computer security.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The brazen hackers had deeply offended the computer security industry,) Tj
T* (   spurring it into action. In the process, some in the industry had also) Tj
T* (   seen an opportunity to raise its own public profile. The security) Tj
T* (   experts had talked to the law enforcement agencies, who were now) Tj
T* (   clearly sharing information across national borders and closing in) Tj
T* (   fast. The conspirators in) Tj
T* (   the global electronic village were at the point of maximum) Tj
T* (   overreach.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `We could hack Spaf again,' Phoenix volunteered.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `The general public couldn't give a fuck about Eugene Spafford,') Tj
T* (   Electron said, trying to dampen Phoenix's bizarre enthusiasm. He was) Tj
T* (   all for thumbing one's nose at authority, but this was not the way to) Tj
T* (   do it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `It'd be so funny in court, though. The lawyer would call Spaf and) Tj
T* (   say, "So, Mr Spafford, is it true that you are a world-renowned) Tj
T* (   computer security expert?" When he said, "Yes" I'd jump up and go, "I) Tj
T* (   object, your honour, this guy doesn't know jackshit, 'cause I hacked) Tj
T* (   his machine and it was a breeze!"') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Mmm.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Hey, if we don't get busted in the next two weeks, it will be a) Tj
T* (   miracle,' Phoenix continued happily.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I hope not.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `This is a lot of fun!' Phoenix shouted sarcastically. `We're gonna) Tj
T* (   get busted! We're gonna get busted!') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron's jaw fell to the ground. Phoenix was mad. Only a lunatic) Tj
T* (   would behave this way. Mumbling something about how tired he was,) Tj
T* (   Electron said goodbye and hung up.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (   At 5.50 a.m. on 2 April 1990, Electron dragged himself out of bed and) Tj
T* (   made his way to the bathroom. Part way through his visit, the light) Tj
T* (   suddenly went out.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   How strange. Electron opened his eyes wide in the early morning) Tj
T* (   dimness. He returned to his bedroom and began putting on some jeans) Tj
T* (   before going to investigate the problem.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Suddenly, two men in street clothes yanked his window open and jumped) Tj
T* (   through into the room shouting, `GET DOWN ON THE FLOOR!') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Who were these people? Half-naked, Electron stood in the middle of his) Tj
T* (   room, stunned and immobile. He had suspected the police might pay him) Tj
T* (   a visit, but didn't they normally wear uniforms? Didn't they announce) Tj
T* (   themselves?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The two men grabbed Electron, threw him face down onto the floor and) Tj
T* (   pulled his arms behind his back. They jammed handcuffs on his) Tj
T* (   wrists--hard--cutting his skin. Then someone kicked him in the) Tj
T* (   stomach.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Are there any firearms in the house?' one of the men asked.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron couldn't answer because he couldn't breathe. The kick had) Tj
T* (   winded him. He felt someone pull him up from the floor and prop him in) Tj
T* (   a chair. Lights went on everywhere and he could see six or seven) Tj
T* (   people moving around in the hallway. They must have come into the) Tj
T* (   house another way. The ones in the hallway were all wearing bibs with) Tj
T* (   three large letters emblazoned across the front: AFP.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As Electron slowly gathered his wits, he realised why the cops had) Tj
T* (   asked about firearms. He had once joked to Phoenix on the phone about) Tj
T* (   how he was practising with his dad's .22 for when the feds came) Tj
T* (   around. Obviously the feds had been tapping his phone.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   While his father talked with one of the officers in the other room and) Tj
T* (   read the warrant, Electron saw the police pack up his computer) Tj
T* (   gear--worth some $3000--and carry it out of the house. The only thing) Tj
T* (   they didn't discover was the modem. His father had become so expert at) Tj
T* (   hiding it that not even the Australian Federal Police could find it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Several other officers began searching Electron's bedroom, which was) Tj
T* (   no small feat, given the state it was in. The floor was covered in a) Tj
T* (   thick layer of junk. Half crumpled music band posters, lots of) Tj
T* (   scribbled notes with passwords and NUAs, pens, T-shirts both clean and) Tj
T* (   dirty, jeans, sneakers, accounting books, cassettes, magazines, the) Tj
T* (   occasional dirty cup. By the time the police had sifted through it all) Tj
T* (   the room was tidier than when they started.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As they moved into another room at the end of the raid, Electron bent) Tj
T* (   down to pick up one of his posters which had fallen onto the floor. It) Tj
T* (   was a Police Drug Identification Chart--a gift from a friend's) Tj
T* (   father--and there, smack dab in the middle, was a genuine AFP) Tj
T* (   footprint. Now it was a collector's item. Electron smiled to himself) Tj
T* (   and carefully tucked the poster away.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When he went out to the living room, he saw a policemen holding a) Tj
T* (   couple of shovels and he wanted to laugh again. Electron had also once) Tj
T* (   told Phoenix that all his sensitive hacking disks were buried in the) Tj
T* (   backyard. Now the police were going to dig it up in search of) Tj
T* (   something which had been destroyed a few days before. It was too) Tj
T* (   funny.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The police found little evidence of Electron's hacking at his house,) Tj
T* (   but that didn't really matter. They already had almost everything they) Tj
T* (   needed.) Tj

T* (   Later that morning, the police put the 20-year-old Electron into an) Tj
T* (   unmarked car and drove him to the AFP's imposing-looking headquarters) Tj
T* (   at 383 Latrobe Street for questioning.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In the afternoon, when Electron had a break from the endless) Tj
T* (   questions, he walked out to the hallway. The boyish-faced Phoenix,) Tj
T* (   aged eighteen, and fellow Realm member Nom, 21, were walking with) Tj
T* (   police at the other end of the hall. They were too far apart to talk,) Tj
T* (   but Electron smiled. Nom looked worried. Phoenix looked annoyed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron was too intimidated to insist on having a lawyer. What was) Tj
T* (   the point in asking for one anyway? It was clear the police had) Tj
T* (   information they could only have obtained from) Tj
T* (   tapping his phone. They also showed him logs taken from Melbourne) Tj
T* (   University, which had been traced back to his phone. Electron figured) Tj
T* (   the game was up, so he might as well tell them the whole story--or at) Tj
T* (   least as much of it as he had told Phoenix on the phone.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Two officers conducted the interview. The lead interviewer was) Tj
T* (   Detective Constable Glenn Proebstl, which seemed to be pronounced) Tj
T* (   `probe stool'--an unfortunate name, Electron thought. Proebstl was) Tj
T* (   accompanied by Constable Natasha Elliott, who occasionally added a few) Tj
T* (   questions at the end of various interview topics but otherwise kept to) Tj
T* (   herself. Although he had decided to answer their questions truthfully,) Tj
T* (   Electron thought that neither of them knew much about computers and) Tj
T* (   found himself struggling to understand what they were trying to ask.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron had to begin with the basics. He explained what the FINGER) Tj
T* (   command was--how you could type `finger' followed by a username, and) Tj
T* (   then the computer would provide basic information about the user's) Tj
T* (   name and other details.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `So, what is the methodology behind it ... finger ... then, it's) Tj
T* (   normally ... what is the normal command after that to try and get the) Tj
T* (   password out?' Constable Elliott finally completed her convoluted) Tj
T* (   attempt at a question.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The only problem was that Electron had no idea what she was talking) Tj
T* (   about.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Well, um, I mean there is none. I mean you don't use finger like that) Tj
T* (   ...') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Right. OK,' Constable Elliott got down to business. `Well, have you) Tj
T* (   ever used that system before?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Uhm, which system?' Electron had been explaining commands for so long) Tj
T* (   he had forgotten if they were still talking about how he hacked the) Tj
T* (   Lawrence Livermore computer or some other site.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `The finger ... The finger system?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Huh? Electron wasn't quite sure how to answer that question. There was) Tj
T* (   no such thing. Finger was a command, not a computer.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Uh, yes,' he said.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The interview went the same way, jolting awkwardly through computer) Tj
T* (   technology which he understood far better than either officer.) Tj
T* (   Finally, at the end of a long day, Detective Constable Proebstl asked) Tj

T* (   Electron:) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `In your own words, tell me what fascination you find with accessing) Tj
T* (   computers overseas?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Well, basically, it's not for any kind of personal gain or anything,') Tj
T* (   Electron said slowly. It was a surprisingly difficult question to) Tj
T* (   answer. Not because he didn't know the answer, but because it was a) Tj
T* (   difficult answer to describe to someone who had never hacked a) Tj
T* (   computer. `It's just the kick of getting in to a system. I mean, once) Tj
T* (   you are in, you very often get bored and even though you can still) Tj
T* (   access the system, you may never call back.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Because once you've gotten in, it's a challenge over and you don't) Tj
T* (   really care much about it,' Electron continued, struggling. `It's a) Tj
T* (   hot challenge thing, trying to do things that other people are also) Tj
T* (   trying to do but can't.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `So, I mean, I guess it is a sort of ego thing. It's knowing that you) Tj
T* (   can do stuff that other people cannot, and well, it is the) Tj
T* (   challenge and the ego boost you get from doing something well ...) Tj
T* (   where other people try and fail.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A few more questions and the day-long interview finally) Tj
T* (   finished. The police then took Electron to the Fitzroy police) Tj
T* (   station. He guessed it was the nearest location with a JP they could) Tj
T* (   find willing to process a bail application at that hour.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In front of the ugly brick building, Electron noticed a small group of) Tj
T* (   people gathered on the footpath in the dusky light. As the police car) Tj
T* (   pulled up, the group swung into a frenzy of activity, fidgeting in) Tj
T* (   over-the-shoulder briefcases, pulling out notebooks and pens, scooping) Tj
T* (   up big microphones with fuzzy shag covers, turning on TV camera) Tj
T* (   lights.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Oh NO! Electron wasn't prepared for this at all.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Flanked by police, Electron stepped out of the police car and blinked) Tj
T* (   in the glare of photographers' camera flashes and TV camera) Tj
T* (   searchlights. The hacker tried to ignore them, walking as briskly as) Tj
T* (   his captors would allow. Sound recordists and reporters tagged beside) Tj
T* (   him, keeping pace, while the TV cameramen and photographers weaved in) Tj
T* (   front of him. Finally he escaped into the safety of the watchhouse.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   First there was paperwork, followed by the visit to the JP. While) Tj
T* (   shuffling through his papers, the JP gave Electron a big speech about) Tj
T* (   how defendants often claimed to have been beaten by the police.) Tj
T* (   Sitting in the dingy meeting room, Electron felt somewhat confused by) Tj
T* (   the purpose of this tangential commentary. However, the JP's next) Tj
T* (   question cleared things up: `Have you had any problems with your) Tj
T* (   treatment by the police which you would like to record at this time?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron thought about the brutal kick he had suffered while lying on) Tj
T* (   his bedroom floor, then he looked up and found Detective Constable) Tj
T* (   Proebstl staring him in the eye. A slight smile passed across the) Tj
T* (   detective's face.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No,' Electron answered.) Tj

T* (   even stranger. There was another defendant in the lock-up at the) Tj
T* (   moment, a dangerous criminal who had a disease the JP knew about, and) Tj
T* (   the JP could decide to lock Electron up with that criminal instead of) Tj
T* (   granting him bail.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Was this meant to be helpful warning, or just the gratification of) Tj
T* (   some kind of sadistic tendency? Electron was baffled but he didn't) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   At home over the next few weeks, Electron struggled to come to terms) Tj
T* (   with the fact that he would have to give up hacking forever. He still) Tj
T* (   had his modem, but no computer. Even if he had a machine, he realised) Tj
T* (   it was far too dangerous to even contemplate hacking again.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   So he took up drugs instead.) Tj

T* (                                    [ ]) Tj

T* (   Electron's father waited until the very last days of his illness, in) Tj
T* (   March 1991, before he went into hospital. He knew that once he went) Tj
T* (   in, he would not be coming out again.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   There was so much to do before that trip, so many things to organise.) Tj
T* (   The house, the life insurance paperwork, the will, the funeral, the) Tj
T* (   instructions for the family friend who promised to watch over both) Tj
T* (   children when he was gone. And, of course, the children themselves.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He looked at his two children and worried. Despite their ages of 21) Tj
T* (   and 19, they were in many ways still very sheltered. He realised that) Tj
T* (   Electron's anti-establishment attitude and his sister's emotional) Tj
T* (   remoteness would remain unresolved difficulties at the time of his) Tj
T* (   death. As the cancer progressed, Electron's father tried to tell both) Tj
T* (   children how much he cared for them. He might have been somewhat) Tj
T* (   emotionally remote himself in the past, but with so little time left,) Tj
T* (   he wanted to set the record straight.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   On the issue of Electron's problems with the police, however,) Tj
T* (   Electron's father maintained a hands-off approach. Electron had only) Tj
T* (   talked to his father about his hacking exploits occasionally, usually) Tj
T* (   when he had achieved what he considered to be a very noteworthy hack.) Tj
T* (   His father's view was always the same. Hacking is illegal, he told his) Tj
T* (   son, and the police will probably eventually catch you. Then you will) Tj
T* (   have to deal with the problem yourself. He didn't lecture his son, or) Tj
T* (   forbid Electron from hacking. On this issue he considered his son old) Tj
T* (   enough to make his own choices and live with the consequences.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   True to his word, Electron's father had shown little sympathy for his) Tj
T* (   son's legal predicament after the police raid. He remained neutral on) Tj
T* (   the subject, saying only, `I told you something like this would happen) Tj
T* (   and now it is your responsibility'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron's hacking case progressed slowly over the year, as did his) Tj
T* (   university accounting studies. In March 1991, he faced committal) Tj
T* (   proceedings and had to decide whether to fight his committal.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   unauthorised access to computers in the US and Australia. A few were) Tj
T* (   aggravated offences, for obtaining access to data of a commercial) Tj
T* (   nature. On one count each, the DPP \(the Office of the Commonwealth) Tj
T* (   Director of Public Prosecutions\) said he altered and erased data.) Tj
T* (   Those two counts were the result of his inserting backdoors for) Tj
T* (   himself, not because he did damage to any files. The evidence was) Tj
T* (   reasonably strong: telephone intercepts and datataps on Phoenix's) Tj
T* (   phone which showed him talking to Electron about hacking; logs of) Tj
T* (   Electron's own sessions in Melbourne University's systems which were) Tj
T* (   traced back to his home phone; and Electron's own confession to the) Tj
T* (   police.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   This was the first major computer hacking case in Australia under the) Tj
T* (   new legislation. It was a test case--the test case for computer) Tj
T* (   hacking in Australia--and the DPP was going in hard. The case had) Tj
T* (   generated seventeen volumes of evidence, totalling some 25000 pages,) Tj
T* (   and Crown prosecutor Lisa West planned to call up to twenty expert) Tj
T* (   witnesses from Australia, Europe and the US.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Those witnesses had some tales to tell about the Australian hackers,) Tj
T* (   who had caused havoc in systems around the world. Phoenix had) Tj
T* (   accidentally deleted a Texas-based company's inventory of assets--the) Tj
T* (   only copy in existence according to Execucom Systems Corporation. The) Tj
T* (   hackers had also baffled security personnel at the US Naval Research) Tj
T* (   Labs. They had bragged to the New York Times. And they forced NASA to) Tj
T* (   cut off its computer network for 24 hours. ) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   AFP Detective Sergeant Ken Day had flown halfway around the world to) Tj
T* (   obtain a witness statement from none other than NASA Langley computer) Tj
T* (   manager Sharon Beskenis--the admin Phoenix had accidentally kicked off) Tj
T* (   her own system when he was trying to get Deszip. Beskenis had been) Tj
T* (   more than happy to oblige and on 24 July 1990 she signed a statement) Tj
T* (   in Virginia, witnessed by Day. Her statement said that, as a result of) Tj
T* (   the hackers' intrusion, `the entire NASA computer system was) Tj
T* (   disconnected from any external communications with the rest of the) Tj
T* (   world' for about 24 hours on 22 February 1990.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In short, Electron thought, there didn't seem to be much chance of) Tj
T* (   winning at the committal hearing. Nom seemed to feel the same way. He) Tj
T* (   faced two counts, both `knowingly concerned' with Phoenix obtaining) Tj
T* (   unauthorised access. One was for NASA Langley, the other for) Tj
T* (   CSIRO--the Zardoz file. Nom didn't fight his committal either,) Tj
T* (   although Legal Aid's refusal) Tj
T* (   to fund a lawyer for the procedure no doubt weighed in his) Tj
T* (   decision.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   On 6 March 1991, Magistrate Robert Langton committed Electron and Nom) Tj
T* (   to stand trial in the Victorian County Court.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Phoenix, however, didn't agree with his fellow hackers' point of view.) Tj
T* (   With financial help from his family, he had decided to fight his) Tj
T* (   committal. He wasn't going to hand this case to the prosecution on a) Tj
T* (   silver platter, and they would have to fight him every step of the) Tj
T* (   way, dragging him forward from proceeding to proceeding. His) Tj
T* (   barrister, Felicity Hampel, argued the court should throw out 47 of) Tj
T* (   the 48 charges against her client on jurisdictional grounds. All but) Tj
T* (   one charge--breaking into the CSIRO machine in order to steal) Tj
T* (   Zardoz--related to hacking activities outside Australia. How could an) Tj
T* (   Australian court claim jurisdiction over a hacked computer in Texas?) Tj

T* (   Privately, Phoenix worried more about being extradited to the US than) Tj
T* (   dealing with the Australian courts, but publicly he was going into the) Tj
T* (   committal with all guns blazing. It was a test case in many ways; not) Tj
T* (   only the first major hacking case in Australia but also the first time) Tj
T* (   a hacker had fought Australian committal proceedings for computer) Tj
T* (   crimes.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The prosecution agreed to drop one of the 48 counts, noting it was a) Tj
T* (   duplicate charge, but the backdown was a pyrrhic victory for Phoenix.) Tj
T* (   After a two-day committal hearing, Magistrate John Wilkinson decided) Tj
T* (   Hampel's jurisdictional argument didn't hold water and on 14 August) Tj
T* (   1991 he committed Phoenix to stand trial in the County Court.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   By the day of Electron's committal, in March, Electron's father had) Tj
T* (   begun his final decline. The bowel cancer created a roller-coaster of) Tj
T* (   good and bad days, but soon there were only bad days, and they were) Tj
T* (   getting worse. On the last day of March, the doctors told him that it) Tj
T* (   was finally time to make the trip to hospital. He stubbornly refused) Tj
T* (   to go, fighting their advice, questioning their authority. They) Tj
T* (   quietly urged him again. He protested. Finally, they insisted.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron and his sister stayed with their father for hours that day,) Tj
T* (   and the following one. Their father had other visitors to keep his) Tj
T* (   spirits up, including his brother who fervently beseeched him to) Tj
T* (   accept Jesus Christ as his personal saviour before he died. That way,) Tj
T* (   he wouldn't burn in hell. Electron looked at his uncle, disbelieving.) Tj
T* (   He couldn't believe his father was having to put up with such crap on) Tj
T* (   his deathbed. Still, Electron chose to be discreet. Apart from an) Tj
T* (   occasional rolling of the eyes, he kept his peace at his father's) Tj
T* (   bedside.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Perhaps, however, the fervent words did some good, for as Electron's) Tj
T* (   father spoke about the funeral arrangements, he made a strange slip of) Tj
T* (   the tongue. He said `wedding' instead of funeral, then paused,) Tj
T* (   realising his mistake. Glancing slowly down at the intricate braided) Tj
T* (   silver wedding band still on his finger, he smiled frailly and said,) Tj
T* (   `I suppose, in a way, it will be like a wedding'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron and his sister went to hospital every day for four days, to) Tj
T* (   sit by their father's bed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   At 6 a.m. on the fifth day, the telephone rang. It was the family) Tj
T* (   friend their father had asked to watch over them. Their father's life) Tj
T* (   signs were very, very weak, fluttering on the edge of death.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Electron and his sister arrived at the hospital, the nurse's face) Tj
T* (   said everything. They were too late. Their father had died ten minutes) Tj
T* (   before they arrived. Electron broke down and wept. He hugged his) Tj
T* (   sister, who, for a brief moment, seemed almost reachable. Driving them) Tj
T* (   back to the house, the family friend stopped and bought them an) Tj
T* (   answering machine.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `You'll need this when everyone starts calling in,' she told them.) Tj
T* (   `You might not want to talk to anyone for a while.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In the months after his bust in 1990 Electron began smoking marijuana) Tj
T* (   regularly. At first, as with many other university students, it was a) Tj
T* (   social thing. Some friends dropped by, they happened to have a few) Tj
T* (   joints, and so everybody went out for a night on the town. When he was) Tj
T* (   in serious hacking mode, he never smoked. A clear head was much too) Tj

T* (   important. Besides, the high he got from hacking was a hundred times) Tj
T* (   better than anything dope could ever do for him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Phoenix appeared on the front page of the New York Times,) Tj
T* (   Electron gave up hacking. And even if he had been tempted to return to) Tj
T* (   it, he didn't have anything to hack with after the police took his) Tj
T* (   only computer. Electron found himself casting around for something to) Tj
T* (   distract him from his father's deteriorating condition and the void) Tj
T* (   left by giving up hacking. His accounting studies didn't quite fit the) Tj
T* (   bill. They had always seemed empty, but never more so than now.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Smoking pot filled the void. So did tripping. Filled it very nicely.) Tj
T* (   Besides, he told himself, it's harder to get caught smoking dope in) Tj
T* (   your friends' houses than hacking in your own. The habit grew) Tj
T* (   gradually. Soon, he was smoking dope at home. New friends began coming) Tj
T* (   around, and they seemed to have drugs with them all the time--not just) Tj
T* (   occasionally, and not just for fun.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron and his sister had been left the family home and enough money) Tj
T* (   to give them a modest income. Electron began spending this money on) Tj
T* (   his new-found hobby. A couple of Electron's new friends moved into the) Tj
T* (   house for a few months. His sister didn't like them dealing drugs out) Tj
T* (   of the place, but Electron didn't care what was happening around him.) Tj
T* (   He just sat in his room, listening to his stereo, smoking dope,) Tj
T* (   dropping acid and watching the walls.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The headphones blocked out everyone in the house, and, more) Tj
T* (   importantly, what was going on inside Electron's own head. Billy) Tj
T* (   Bragg. Faith No More. Cosmic Psychos. Celibate Rifles. Jane's) Tj
T* (   Addiction. The Sex Pistols. The Ramones. Music gave Electron a) Tj
T* (   pinpoint, a figurative dot of light on his forehead where he could) Tj
T* (   focus his mind. Blot out the increasingly strange thoughts creeping) Tj
T* (   through his consciousness.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   His father was alive. He was sure of it. He knew it, like he knew the) Tj
T* (   sun would rise tomorrow. Yet he had seen his father lying, dead, in) Tj
T* (   the hospital bed. It didn't make sense.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   So he took another hit from the bong, floated in slow motion to his) Tj
T* (   bed, lay down, carefully slid the earphones over his head, closed his) Tj
T* (   eyes and tried to concentrate on what the Red Hot Chilli Peppers were) Tj
T* (   saying instead. When that wasn't enough, he ventured down the hallway,) Tj
T* (   down to his new friends--the friends with the acid tabs. Then, eight) Tj
T* (   more hours without having to worry about the strange thoughts.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Soon people began acting strangely too. They would tell Electron) Tj
T* (   things, but he had trouble understanding them. Pulling a milk carton) Tj
T* (   from the fridge and sniffing it, Electron's sister might say, `Milk's) Tj
T* (   gone off'. But Electron wasn't sure what she meant. He would look at) Tj
T* (   her warily. Maybe she was trying to tell him something else, about) Tj
T* (   spiders. Milking spiders for venom.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When thoughts like these wafted through Electron's mind, they) Tj
T* (   disturbed him, lingering like a sour smell. So he floated back to the) Tj
T* (   safety of his room and listened to songs by Henry Rollins.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After several months in this cloudy state of limbo, Electron awoke one) Tj
T* (   day to find the Crisis Assessment Team--a mobile psychiatric team--in) Tj
T* (   his bedroom. They asked him questions, then they tried to feed him) Tj
T* (   little blue tablets. Electron didn't want to take the tablets. Were) Tj

T* (   little blue pills placebos? He was sure they were. Or maybe they were) Tj
T* (   something more sinister.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Finally, the CAT workers convinced Electron to take the Stelazine) Tj
T* (   tablet. But when they left, terrifying things began to happen.) Tj
T* (   Electron's eyes rolled uncontrollably to the back of his head. His) Tj
T* (   head twisted to the left. His mouth dropped open, very wide. Try as he) Tj
T* (   might, he couldn't shut it, any more than he could turn his head) Tj
T* (   straight. Electron saw himself in the mirror and he panicked. He) Tj
T* (   looked like a character out of a horror) Tj
T* (   picture.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   His new house-mates reacted to this strange new behaviour by trying to) Tj
T* (   psychoanalyse Electron, which was less than helpful. They discussed) Tj
T* (   him as if he wasn't even present. He felt like a ghost and, agitated) Tj
T* (   and confused, he began telling his friends that he was going to kill) Tj
T* (   himself. Someone called the CAT team again. This time they refused to) Tj
T* (   leave unless he would guarantee not to attempt suicide.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron refused. So they had him committed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Inside the locked psychiatric ward of Plenty Hospital \(now known as) Tj
T* (   NEMPS\), Electron believed that, although he had gone crazy, he wasn't) Tj
T* (   really in a hospital psychiatric ward. The place was just supposed to) Tj
T* (   look like one. His father had set it) Tj
T* (   all up.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron refused to believe anything that anyone told him. It was all) Tj
T* (   lies. They said one thing, but always meant another.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He had proof. Electron read a list of patients' names on the wall and) Tj
T* (   found one called Tanas. That name had a special meaning. It was an) Tj
T* (   anagram for the word `Santa'. But Santa Claus was a myth, so the name) Tj
T* (   Tanas appearing on the hospital list proved to him that he shouldn't) Tj
T* (   listen to anything anyone told him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron ate his meals mostly in silence, trying to ignore the) Tj
T* (   voluntary and involuntary patients who shared the dining hall. One) Tj
T* (   lunchtime, a stranger sat down at Electron's table and started talking) Tj
T* (   to him. Electron found it excruciatingly painful talking to other) Tj
T* (   people, and he kept wishing the stranger would go away.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The stranger talked about how good the drugs were in) Tj
T* (   hospital.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Mm,' Electron said. `I used to do a lot of drugs.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `How much is a lot?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I spent $28000 on dope alone in about four months.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Wow,' the stranger said, impressed. `Of course, you don't have to pay) Tj
T* (   for drugs. You can always get them for free. I do.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `You do?' Electron asked, somewhat perplexed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Sure! All the time,' the stranger said grandly. `No problem. Just) Tj

T* (   and then began yelling at the top of his lungs. He waved his arms) Tj
T* (   around frantically and shouted abuse at the other patients.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Two nurses came running from the observation room. One of them tried) Tj
T* (   to calm the stranger down while the other quickly measured out various) Tj
T* (   pills and grabbed a cup of water. The stranger swallowed the pills,) Tj
T* (   chased them with a swig of water and sat down quietly. The nurses) Tj
T* (   retreated, glancing back over their shoulders.) Tj

T* (   `See?' The stranger said. `Well, I'd better be on my way, before the) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron watched, amazed, as the stranger picked up his bag, walked) Tj
T* (   through the dining-hall door, and straight out the front door of the) Tj
T* (   psychiatric ward.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After a month, the psychiatrists reluctantly allowed Electron to leave) Tj
T* (   the hospital in order to stay with his maternal grandmother in) Tj
T* (   Queensland. He was required to see a psychiatrist regularly. He spent) Tj
T* (   his first few days in Queensland believing he was Jesus Christ. But he) Tj
T* (   didn't hold onto that one for long. After two weeks of patiently) Tj
T* (   waiting and checking for signs of the imminent apocalypse, consistent) Tj
T* (   with the second coming, he decided he was really the reincarnation of) Tj
T* (   Buddha.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In late February 1992, after three months of psychiatric care up) Tj
T* (   north, Electron returned to Melbourne and his university studies, with) Tj
T* (   a bag full of medication. Prozac, major tranquillisers, Lithium. The) Tj
T* (   daily routine went smoothly for a while. Six Prozac--two in the) Tj
T* (   morning, two at midday and two at night. Another anti-depressant to be) Tj
T* (   taken at night. Also at night, the anti-side effect tablets to combat) Tj
T* (   the involuntary eye-rolling, jaw-dropping and neck-twisting associated) Tj
T* (   with the anti-depressants.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   All of it was designed to help him deal with what had by) Tj
T* (   now become a long list of diagnoses. Cannabis psychosis.) Tj
T* (   Schizophrenia. Manic depression. Unipolar effective disorder.) Tj
T* (   Schizophrenaform. Amphetamine psychosis. Major effective disorder.) Tj
T* (   Atypical psychosis. And his own personal favourite--facticious) Tj
T* (   disorder, or faking it to get into hospital. But the medication wasn't) Tj
T* (   helping much. Electron still felt wretched, and returning to a host of) Tj
T* (   problems in Melbourne made things worse.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Because of his illness, Electron had been largely out of the loop of) Tj
T* (   legal proceedings. Sunny Queensland provided a welcome escape. Now he) Tj
T* (   was back in Victoria facing a tedious university course in accounting,) Tj
T* (   an ongoing battle with mental illness, federal charges which could see) Tj
T* (   him locked up for ten years, and publicity surrounding the first major) Tj
T* (   hacking case in Australia. It was going to be a hard winter.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   To make matters worse, Electron's medication interfered with his) Tj
T* (   ability to study properly. The anti-side effect pills relaxed the) Tj
T* (   muscles in his eyes, preventing them from focusing. The writing on the) Tj
T* (   blackboard at the front of the lecture hall was nothing but a hazy) Tj
T* (   blur. Taking notes was also a problem. The medication made his hands) Tj
T* (   tremble, so he couldn't write properly. By the end of a lecture,) Tj
T* (   Electron's notes were as unreadable as the blackboard. Frustrated,) Tj
T* (   Electron stopped taking his medicine, started smoking dope again and) Tj
T* (   soon felt a little better. When the dope wasn't enough, he turned to) Tj
T* (   magic mushrooms and hallucinogenic cactus.) Tj

T* (   was being done'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   This case had American pressure written all over it. Electron's) Tj
T* (   barrister, Boris Kayser, said he suspected that `the) Tj
T* (   Americans'--American institutions, companies or government) Tj
T* (   agencies--were indirectly funding some of the prosecution's case by) Tj
T* (   offering to pay for US witnesses to attend the trial. The Americans) Tj
T* (   wanted to see the Australian hackers go down, and they were throwing) Tj
T* (   all their best resources at the case to make sure it happened.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   There was one other thing--in some ways the most disturbing matter of) Tj
T* (   all. In the course of the legal to-ing and fro-ing, Electron was told) Tj
T* (   that it was the US Secret Service back in 1988 which had triggered the) Tj
T* (   AFP investigation into The Realm hackers--an investigation which had) Tj
T* (   led to Electron's bust and current legal problems. The Secret Service) Tj
T* (   was after the hackers who broke into Citibank.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As it happened, Electron had never touched Citibank. Credit cards) Tj
T* (   couldn't interest him less. He found banks boring and, the way he) Tj
T* (   looked at it, their computers were full of mundane numbers belonging) Tj
T* (   to the world of accounting. He had already suffered through enough of) Tj
T* (   those tedious types of numbers in his university course. Unless he) Tj
T* (   wanted to steal from banks--something he would not do--there was no) Tj
T* (   point in breaking into their computers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But the US Secret Service was very interested in banks--and in) Tj
T* (   Phoenix. For they didn't just believe that Phoenix had been inside) Tj
T* (   Citibank's computers. They believed he had masterminded the Citibank) Tj
T* (   attack.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   And why did the US Secret Service think that? Because, Electron was) Tj
T* (   told, Phoenix had gone around bragging about it in the underground. He) Tj
T* (   hadn't just told people he had hacked into Citibank computers, he) Tj
T* (   reportedly boasted that he had stolen some $50000 from the bank.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Going through his legal brief, Electron had discovered something which) Tj
T* (   seemed to confirm what he was being told. The warrant for the) Tj
T* (   telephone tap on both of Phoenix's home phones mentioned a potential) Tj
T* (   `serious loss to Citibank' as a justification for the warrant.) Tj
T* (   Strangely, the typed words had been crossed out in the handwritten) Tj
T* (   scrawl of the judge who approved the warrant. But they were still) Tj
T* (   legible. No wonder the US Secret Service began chasing the case,) Tj
T* (   Electron thought. Banks get upset when they think people have found a) Tj
T* (   way to rip them off anonymously.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Electron knew that Phoenix hadn't stolen any money from Citibank.) Tj
T* (   Rather, he had been circulating fantastic stories about himself to) Tj
T* (   puff up his image in the underground, and in the process had managed) Tj
T* (   to get them all busted.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In September 1992, Phoenix rang Electron suggesting they get together) Tj
T* (   to discuss the case. Electron wondered why. Maybe he suspected) Tj
T* (   something, sensing that the links binding them were weak, and becoming) Tj
T* (   weaker by the month. That Electron's mental illness had changed his) Tj
T* (   perception of the world. That his increasingly remote attitude to) Tj
T* (   Phoenix suggested an underlying anger about the continual bragging.) Tj
T* (   Whatever the reason, Phoenix's gnawing worry must have been confirmed) Tj
T* (   when Electron put off meeting with him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   With these thoughts fermenting in his mind, Electron listened with) Tj

T* (   he was concerned that some British hackers--read Pad and) Tj

T* (   it into the Internet. The unnamed British hackers would then be able) Tj
T* (   to cause maximum havoc on thousands of Internet sites.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was true that Gandalf and Pad had captured copies of various worm) Tj
T* (   source codes. They fished around inside SPAN until they surfaced with) Tj
T* (   a copy of the Father Christmas worm. And, after finally successfully) Tj
T* (   hacking Russell Brand's machine at LLNL, they deftly lifted a complete) Tj
T* (   copy of the WANK worm. In Brand's machine, they also found a) Tj
T* (   description of how someone had broken into SPAN looking for the WANK) Tj
T* (   worm code, but hadn't found it. `That was me breaking into SPAN to) Tj
T* (   look around,' Gandalf laughed, relaying the tale to Pad.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Despite their growing library of worm code, Pad had no intention of) Tj
T* (   writing any such worm. They simply wanted the code to study what) Tj

T* (   new. The British hackers prided themselves on never having done) Tj
T* (   anything destructive to systems they hacked. In places where they knew) Tj

T* (   green men are at it again'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   At the University of Lancaster, the hackers wrote a message to the) Tj
T* (   admins which said: `Don't do anything naughty. We have a good image) Tj
T* (   around the world, so please don't tarnish it or start making up) Tj
T* (   stories about us messing up systems. Don't hold your breath for us to) Tj
T* (   hack you, but keep us in mind.' Wherever they went, their message was) Tj
T* (   the same.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Nonetheless Pad visualised a scenario where Spaf whipped up the) Tj
T* (   computer security and law enforcement people into a frenzied panic and) Tj
T* (   tried to pin all sorts of things on the British hackers, none of which) Tj
T* (   they had done. The underground saw Spaf as being rabid in his attack) Tj
T* (   on hackers, based largely on his response to the RTM worm. And Gandalf) Tj
T* (   had hacked Spaf's machine.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The crackdown on the Australians, combined with the discovery of the) Tj
T* (   Spaf file, had a profound effect on Pad. Always cautious anyway, he) Tj
T* (   decided to give up hacking. It was a difficult decision, and weaning) Tj
T* (   himself from exploring systems night after night was no easy task.) Tj
T* (   However, in the face of what had happened to Electron and Phoenix,) Tj
T* (   continuing to hack didn't seem worth the risk.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Pad gave up hacking, he bought his own NUI so he could access) Tj
T* (   places like Altos legitimately. The NUI was expensive--about) Tj
T* (   [sterling]10 an hour--but he was never on for long. Leisurely chats of) Tj
T* (   the type he once enjoyed in Altos were out of the question, but at) Tj
T* (   least he could mail letters to his friends like Theorem and Gandalf.) Tj
T* (   There would have been easier ways to maintain his friendship with) Tj
T* (   Gandalf, who lived in Liverpool, only an hour's drive away. But it) Tj
T* (   wouldn't be the same. Pad and Gandalf had never met, or even talked on) Tj
T* (   the phone. They talked on-line, and via email. That was the way they) Tj
T* (   related.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad also had other reasons for giving up hacking. It was an expensive) Tj
T* (   habit in Britain because British Telecom time-charged for local phone) Tj
T* (   calls. In Australia, a hacker could stay on-line for hours, jumping) Tj
T* (   from one computer to another through the data network, all for the) Tj
T* (   cost of one local call. Like the Australians, Pad could launch his) Tj
T* (   hacking sessions from a local uni or X.25 dial-up. However, an) Tj
T* (   all-night hacking session based on a single phone call might still) Tj
T* (   cost him [sterling]5 or more in timed-call charges--a considerable) Tj
T* (   amount of money for an unemployed young man. As it was, Pad had) Tj
T* (   already been forced to stop hacking for brief periods when he ran out) Tj
T* (   of his dole money.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Although Pad didn't think he could be prosecuted for hacking under) Tj
T* (   British law in early 1990, he knew that Britain was about to enact its) Tj
T* (   own computer crime legislation--the Computer Misuse Act 1990--in) Tj
T* (   August. The 22-year-old hacker decided that it was better to quit) Tj
T* (   while he was ahead.) Tj

T* (   And he did, for a while at least. Until July 1990, when Gandalf, two) Tj
T* (   years his junior, tempted him with one final hack before the new Act) Tj
T* (   came into force. Just one last fling, Gandalf told him. After that) Tj
T* (   last fling in July, Pad stopped hacking again.) Tj

T* (   On 27 June 1991, Pad was sitting in the front room of his parent's) Tj
T* (   comfortable home in greater Manchester watching the last remnants of) Tj
T* (   daylight disappear on one of the longest days of the year. He loved) Tj
T* (   summer, loved waking up to streaks of sunlight sneaking through the) Tj
T* (   cracks in his bedroom curtain. He often thought to himself, it doesn't) Tj
T* (   get much better than this.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Around 11 p.m. he flicked on his modem and his Atari 520 ST computer) Tj
T* (   in the front sitting room. There were two Atari computers in the) Tj
T* (   house--indicative of his deep enthusiasm for computers since neither) Tj
T* (   his siblings nor his parents had any interest in programming. Most of) Tj
T* (   the time, however, Pad left the older Atari alone. His elder brother,) Tj
T* (   an aspiring chemist, used it for writing his PhD thesis.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Before dialling out, Pad checked that no-one was on the house's single) Tj
T* (   phone line. Finding it free, he went to check his email on Lutzifer. A) Tj
T* (   few minutes after watching his machine connect to the German board, he) Tj
T* (   heard a soft thud, followed by a creaking. Pad stopped typing, looked) Tj
T* (   up from his machine and listened. He wondered if his brother, reading) Tj
T* (   in their bedroom upstairs, or his parents, watching telly in the back) Tj
T* (   lounge room, could hear the creaking.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The sound became more pronounced and Pad swung around and looked) Tj
T* (   toward the hallway. In a matter of seconds, the front door frame had) Tj
T* (   been cracked open, prising the door away from its lock. The wood had) Tj
T* (   been torn apart by some sort of car jack, pumped up until the door) Tj
T* (   gave way.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Suddenly, a group of men burst through from the front doorstep, dashed) Tj
T* (   down the long hallway and shot up the carpeted stairs to Pad's) Tj
T* (   bedroom.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Still sitting at his computer downstairs, Pad swiftly flicked his) Tj
T* (   modem, and then his computer, off--instantly killing his connection) Tj
T* (   and everything on his screen. He turned back toward the door leading) Tj
T* (   to the sitting room and strained to hear what was happening upstairs.) Tj
T* (   If he wasn't so utterly surprised, he would almost have laughed. He) Tj
T* (   realised that when the police had dashed up to his bedroom, they had) Tj
T* (   been chasing every stereotype about hackers they had probably ever) Tj
T* (   read. The boy. In his bedroom. Hunched over his computer. Late at) Tj
T* (   night.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   They did find a young man in the bedroom, with a computer. But it was) Tj
T* (   the wrong one, and for all intents and purposes the wrong computer. It) Tj
T* (   took the police almost ten minutes of quizzing Pad's brother to work) Tj
T* (   out their mistake.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Hearing a commotion, Pad's parents had rushed into the hallway while) Tj
T* (   Pad peered from the doorway of the front sitting room. A uniformed) Tj
T* (   police officer ushered everyone back into the room, and began asking) Tj
T* (   Pad questions.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Do you use computers? Do you use the name Pad on computers?' they) Tj
T* (   asked.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad concluded the game was up. He answered their questions truthfully.) Tj
T* (   Hacking was not such a serious crime after all, he thought. It wasn't) Tj
T* (   as if he had stolen money or anything. This would be a drama, but he) Tj
T* (   was easy-going. He would roll with the punches, cop a slap on the) Tj
T* (   wrist and soon the whole thing would be over and done with.) Tj

T* (   gyros on aircraft, had always encouraged their children's interest in) Tj
T* (   the sciences.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The policeman returned those books to the shelves, only picking out) Tj
T* (   the computer books, textbooks from programming and maths classes Pad) Tj
T* (   had taken at a Manchester university. The officer carefully slid them) Tj
T* (   inside plastic bags to be taken away as) Tj
T* (   evidence.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then the police picked through Pad's music tapes--The Stone Roses,) Tj
T* (   Pixies, New Order, The Smiths and lots of indie music from the) Tj
T* (   flourishing Manchester music scene. No evidence of anything but an) Tj
T* (   eclectic taste in music there.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Another policeman opened Pad's wardrobe and peered inside. `Anything) Tj
T* (   in here of interest?' he asked.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No,' Pad answered. `It's all over here.' He pointed to the box of) Tj
T* (   computer disks.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad didn't think there was much point in the police tearing the place) Tj
T* (   to pieces, when they would ultimately find everything they wanted) Tj
T* (   anyway. Nothing was hidden. Unlike the Australian hackers, Pad hadn't) Tj
T* (   been expecting the police at all. Although part of the data on his) Tj
T* (   hard drive was encrypted, there was plenty of incriminating evidence) Tj
T* (   in the un-encrypted files.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad couldn't hear exactly what his parents were talking about with the) Tj
T* (   police in the other room, but he could tell they were calm. Why) Tj
T* (   shouldn't they be? It wasn't as if their son had done anything) Tj
T* (   terrible. He hadn't beaten someone up in a fist fight at a pub, or) Tj
T* (   robbed anyone. He hadn't hit someone while drunk driving. No, they) Tj
T* (   thought, he had just been fiddling around with computers. Maybe poking) Tj
T* (   around where he shouldn't have been, but that was hardly a serious) Tj
T* (   crime. They needn't worry. It wasn't as if he was going to prison or) Tj
T* (   anything. The police would sort it all out. Maybe some sort of) Tj
T* (   citation, and the matter would be over and done. Pad's mother even) Tj
T* (   offered to make cups of tea for the police.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   One of the police struck up a conversation with Pad off to the side as) Tj
T* (   he paused to drink his tea. He seemed to know that Pad was on the) Tj
T* (   dole, and with a completely straight face, he said, `If you wanted a) Tj
T* (   job, why didn't you just join the police?') Tj

T* (   Pad paused for a reality check. Here he was being raided by nearly a) Tj
T* (   dozen law enforcement officers--including representatives from BT and) Tj
T* (   Scotland Yard's computer crimes unit--for hacking hundreds of) Tj
T* (   computers and this fellow wanted to know why he hadn't just become a) Tj
T* (   copper?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He tried not to laugh. Even if he hadn't been busted, there is no way) Tj
T* (   he would ever have contemplated joining the police. Never in a million) Tj
T* (   years. His family and friends, while showing a pleasant veneer of) Tj
T* (   middle-class orderliness, were fundamentally anti-establishment. Many) Tj
T* (   knew that Pad had been hacking, and which sites he had penetrated.) Tj
T* (   Their attitude was: Hacking Big Brother? Good on you.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   His parents were torn, wanting to encourage Pad's interest in) Tj
T* (   computers but also worrying their son spent an inordinate amount of) Tj
T* (   time glued to the screen. Their mixed feelings mirrored Pad's own) Tj
T* (   occasional concern.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   While deep in the throes of endless hacking nights, he would suddenly) Tj
T* (   sit upright and ask himself, What am I doing here, fucking around on a) Tj
T* (   computer all day and night? Where is this heading? What about the rest) Tj
T* (   of life? Then he would disentangle himself from hacking for a few days) Tj
T* (   or weeks. He would go down to the university pub to drink with his) Tj
T* (   mostly male group of friends from his course.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Tall, with short brown hair, a slender physique and a handsomely) Tj
T* (   boyish face, the soft-spoken Pad would have been considered attractive) Tj
T* (   by many intelligent girls. The problem was finding those sort of) Tj
T* (   girls. He hadn't met many when he was studying at university--there) Tj
T* (   were few women in his maths and computer classes. So he and his) Tj
T* (   friends used to head down to the Manchester nightclubs for the social) Tj
T* (   scene and the good music.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad went downstairs with one of the officers and watched as the police) Tj
T* (   unplugged his 1200 baud modem, then tucked it into a plastic bag. He) Tj
T* (   had bought that modem when he was eighteen. The police unplugged) Tj
T* (   cables, bundled them up and slipped them into labelled plastic bags.) Tj
T* (   They gathered up his 20 megabyte hard drive and monitor. More plastic) Tj
T* (   bags and labels.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   One of the officers called Pad over to the front door. The jack was) Tj
T* (   still wedged across the mutilated door frame. The police had broken) Tj
T* (   down the door instead of knocking because they wanted to catch the) Tj
T* (   hacker in the act--on-line. The officer motioned for Pad to follow) Tj
T* (   him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Come on,' he said, leading the hacker into the night. `We're taking) Tj
T* (   you to the station.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad spent the night in a cell at the Salford Crescent police) Tj
T* (   station, alone. No rough crims, and no other hackers either.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He settled into one of the metal cots lined against the perimeter of) Tj
T* (   the cell, but sleep evaded him. Pad wondered if Gandalf had been) Tj
T* (   raided as well. There was no sign of him, but then again, the police) Tj
T* (   would hardly be stupid enough to lock up the two hackers together. He) Tj
T* (   tossed and turned, trying to push thoughts from his head.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad had fallen into hacking almost by accident. Compared to others in) Tj
T* (   the underground, he had taken it up at a late age--around nineteen.) Tj

T* (   Altos had been the catalyst. Visiting BBSes, he read a file describing) Tj
T* (   not only what Altos was, but how to get there--complete with NUI.) Tj
T* (   Unlike the Australian underground, the embryonic British underground) Tj
T* (   had no shortage of NUIs. Someone had discovered a stack of BT NUIs and) Tj
T* (   posted them on BBSes across England.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad followed the directions in the BBS file and soon found himself in) Tj
T* (   the German chat channel. Like Theorem, he marvelled at the brave new) Tj
T* (   live world of Altos. It was wonderful, a big international party.) Tj
T* (   After all, it wasn't every day he got to talk with Australians, Swiss,) Tj
T* (   Germans, Italians and Americans. Before long, he had taken up hacking) Tj
T* (   like so many other Altos regulars.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Hacking as a concept had always intrigued him. As a teenager, the film) Tj
T* (   War Games had dazzled him. The idea that computers could communicate) Tj
T* (   with each over telephone lines enthralled the sixteen-year-old,) Tj
T* (   filling his mind with new ideas. Sometime after that he saw a) Tj
T* (   television report on a group of hackers who claimed that they had used) Tj
T* (   their skills to move satellites around in space--the same story which) Tj
T* (   had first caught Electron's imagination.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad had grown up in Greater Manchester. More than a century before,) Tj
T* (   the region had been a textile boom-town. But the thriving economy did) Tj
T* (   not translate into great wealth for the masses. In the early 1840s,) Tj
T* (   Friedrich Engels had worked in his father's cotton-milling factory in) Tj
T* (   the area, and the suffering) Tj
T* (   he saw in the region influenced his most famous work, The Communist) Tj
T* (   Manifesto, published in 1848.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Manchester wore the personality of a working-class town, a place where) Tj
T* (   people often disliked the establishment and) Tj
T* (   distrusted authority figures. The 1970s and 1980s had not been kind to) Tj
T* (   most of Greater Manchester, with unemployment and urban decay) Tj
T* (   disfiguring the once-proud textile hub. But this decay only appeared) Tj
T* (   to strengthen an underlying resolve among many from the working) Tj
T* (   classes to challenge the symbols of power.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad didn't live in a public housing high-rise. He lived in a suburban) Tj
T* (   middle-class area, in an old, working-class town removed from the) Tj
T* (   dismal inner-city. But like many people from the north, he disliked) Tj
T* (   pretensions. Indeed, he harboured a healthy degree of good-natured) Tj
T* (   scepticism, perhaps stemming from a culture of mates whose favourite) Tj
T* (   pastime was pulling each other's leg down at the pub.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   This scepticism was in full-gear as he watched the story of how) Tj
T* (   hackers supposedly moved satellites around in space, but somehow the) Tj
T* (   idea slipped through the checkpoints and captured his imagination,) Tj
T* (   just as it had done with Electron. He felt a desire to find out for) Tj
T* (   himself if it was true and he began pursuing hacking in enthusiastic) Tj
T* (   bursts. At first it was any moderately interesting system. Then he) Tj
T* (   moved to the big-name systems--computers belonging to large) Tj
T* (   institutions. Eventually, working with the Australians, he learned to) Tj
T* (   target computer security experts. That was, after all, where the) Tj
T* (   treasure was stored.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In the morning at the police station, a guard gave Pad something to) Tj
T* (   eat which might have passed for food. Then he was escorted into an) Tj
T* (   interview room with two plain-clothed officers and a BT) Tj
T* (   representative.) Tj

T* (   Did he want a lawyer? No. He had nothing to hide. Besides, the police) Tj
T* (   had already seized evidence from his house, including unencrypted data) Tj
T* (   logs of his hacking sessions. How could he argue against that? So he) Tj
T* (   faced his stern inquisitors and answered their questions willingly.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Suddenly things began to take a different turn when they began asking) Tj
T* (   about the `damage' he had done inside the Greater London Polytechnic's) Tj
T* (   computers. Damage? What damage? Pad certainly hadn't damaged anything.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Yes, the police told him. The damage totalling almost a quarter of a) Tj
T* (   million pounds.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad gasped in horror. A quarter of a million pounds? He thought back) Tj
T* (   to his many forays into the system. He had been a little mischievous,) Tj
T* (   changing the welcome message to `Hi' and signing it 8lgm. He had made) Tj
T* (   a few accounts for himself so he could log in at a later date. That) Tj
T* (   seemed to be nothing special, however, since he and Gandalf had a) Tj
T* (   habit of making accounts called 8lgm for themselves in JANET systems.) Tj
T* (   He had also erased logs of his activities to cover his tracks, but) Tj
T* (   again, this was not unusual, and he had certainly never deleted any) Tj
T* (   computer users' files. The whole thing had just been a bit of fun, a) Tj
T* (   bit of cat and mouse gaming with the system admins. There was nothing) Tj
T* (   he could recall which would account for that kind of damage. Surely) Tj
T* (   they had the wrong hacker?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   No, he was the right one all right. Eighty investigators from BT,) Tj
T* (   Scotland Yard and other places had been chasing the 8lgm hackers for) Tj
T* (   two years. They had phone traces, logs seized from his computer and) Tj
T* (   logs from the hacked sites. They knew it was him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   For the first time, the true gravity of the situation hit Pad. These) Tj
T* (   people believed in some way that he had committed serious criminal) Tj
T* (   damage, that he had even been malicious.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After about two hours of questioning, they put Pad back in his cell.) Tj
T* (   More questions tomorrow, they told him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Later that afternoon, an officer came in to tell Pad his mother and) Tj
T* (   father were outside. He could meet with them in the visiting area.) Tj
T* (   Talking through a glass barrier, Pad tried to reassure his worried) Tj
T* (   parents. After five minutes, an officer told the family the visit was) Tj
T* (   over. Amid hurried goodbyes under the impatient stare of the guard,) Tj
T* (   Pad's parents told him they had brought something for him to read in) Tj
T* (   his cell. It was the oceanography textbook.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Back in his cell, he tried to read, but he couldn't concentrate. He) Tj
T* (   kept replaying his visits to the London Polytechnic over and over in) Tj
T* (   his mind, searching for how he might have inadvertently done) Tj
T* (   [sterling]250000 worth of damage. Pad was a very good hacker; it) Tj
T* (   wasn't as if he was some fourteen-year-old kid barging through systems) Tj
T* (   like a bull in china shop. He knew how to get in and out of a system) Tj
T* (   without hurting it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Shortly after 8 p.m., as Pad sat on his cot stewing over the police) Tj
T* (   damage claims, sombre music seemed to fill his cell. Slowly at first,) Tj
T* (   an almost imperceptible moaning, which subtly transformed into solemn) Tj
T* (   but recognisable notes. It sounded like Welsh choir music, and it was) Tj
T* (   coming from above him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad looked up at the ceiling. The music--all male voices-- stopped) Tj

T* (   abruptly, then started again, repeating the same heavy, laboured) Tj
T* (   notes. The hacker smiled. The local police choir was practising right) Tj
T* (   above his cell.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After another fitful night, Pad faced one more round of interviews.) Tj
T* (   The police did most of the questioning, but they didn't seem to know) Tj
T* (   much about computers--well, not nearly so much as any good hacker on) Tj
T* (   Altos. Whenever either of the police asked a technical question, they) Tj
T* (   looked over to the BT guy at the other end of the table as if to say,) Tj
T* (   `Does this make any sense?' The BT guy would give a slight nod, then) Tj
T* (   the police looked back at Pad for an answer. Most of the time, he was) Tj
T* (   able to decipher what they thought they were trying to ask, and he) Tj
T* (   answered accordingly.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then it was back to his cell while they processed his charge sheets.) Tj
T* (   Alone again, Pad wondered once more if they had raided Gandalf. Like) Tj
T* (   an answer from above, Pad heard telephone tones through the walls. The) Tj
T* (   police seemed to be playing them over and over. That was when he knew) Tj
T* (   they had Gandalf too.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Gandalf had rigged up a tone dialler in his computer. It sounded as if) Tj
T* (   the police were playing with it, trying to figure it out.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   So, Pad would finally meet Gandalf in person after two years. What) Tj
T* (   would he look like? Would they have the same chemistry in person as) Tj
T* (   on-line? Pad felt like he knew Gandalf, knew his essence, but meeting) Tj
T* (   in person could be a bit tricky.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Explaining that the paperwork, including the charge sheets, had) Tj
T* (   finally been organised, a police officer unlocked Pad's cell door and) Tj
T* (   led him to a foyer, telling him he would be meeting both Gandalf and) Tj
T* (   Wandii. A large collection of police had formed a semi-circle around) Tj
T* (   two other young men. In addition to Scotland Yard's Computer Crimes) Tj
T* (   Unit and BT, at least seven other police forces were involved in the) Tj
T* (   three raids, including those from Greater Manchester, Merseyside and) Tj
T* (   West Yorkshire. The officers were curious about the hackers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   For most of the two years of their investigation, the police didn't) Tj
T* (   even know the hackers' real identities. After such a long, hard chase,) Tj
T* (   the police had been forced to wait a little longer, since they wanted) Tj
T* (   to nab each hacker while he was on-line. That meant hiding outside) Tj
T* (   each hacker's home until he logged in somewhere. Any system would do) Tj
T* (   and they didn't have to be talking to each other on-line--as long as) Tj
T* (   the login was illegal. The police had sat patiently, and finally) Tj
T* (   raided the hackers within hours of each other, so they didn't have) Tj
T* (   time to warn one another.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   So, at the end of the long chase and a well-timed operation, the) Tj
T* (   police wanted to have a look at the hackers up close.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After the officer walked Pad up to the group, he introduced Gandalf.) Tj
T* (   Tall, lean with brown hair and pale skin, he looked a little bit like) Tj
T* (   Pad. The two hackers smiled shyly at each other, before one of the) Tj
T* (   police pointed out Wandii, the seventeen-year-old schoolboy. Pad) Tj
T* (   didn't get a good look at Wandii, because the police quickly lined the) Tj
T* (   hackers up in a row, with Gandalf in the middle, to explain details to) Tj
T* (   them. They were being charged under the Computer Misuse Act of 1990.) Tj
T* (   Court dates would be set and they would be notified.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When they were finally allowed to leave, Wandii seemed to disappear.) Tj

T* (   Pad and Gandalf walked outside, found a couple of benches and lay) Tj

T* (   Gandalf proved to be as easy to talk to in person as he was on-line.) Tj
T* (   They exchanged phone numbers and shared notes on the police raids.) Tj
T* (   Gandalf had insisted on meeting a lawyer before his interviews, but) Tj
T* (   when the lawyer arrived he didn't have the slightest understanding of) Tj
T* (   computer crime. He advised Gandalf to tell the police whatever they) Tj
T* (   wanted to know, so the hacker did.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The trial was being held in London. Pad wondered why, if all three) Tj
T* (   hackers were from the north, the case was being tried in the south.) Tj
T* (   After all, there was a court in Manchester which was high enough to) Tj
T* (   deal with their crimes.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Maybe it was because Scotland Yard was in London. Maybe they had) Tj
T* (   started the paperwork down there. Maybe it was because they were being) Tj
T* (   accused of hacking computers located within the jurisdiction of the) Tj
T* (   Central Criminal Court--that court being the Old Bailey in London. But) Tj
T* (   Pad's cynical side hazarded a different guess--a guess which seemed) Tj
T* (   justified after a few procedural appearances in 1992 before the trial,) Tj
T* (   which was set for 1993. For when Pad arrived at the Bow Street) Tj
T* (   Magistrates Court for his committal in April 1992, he saw it packed) Tj
T* (   out with the media, just as he had anticipated.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A few hackers also fronted up to fly the flag of the underground. One) Tj
T* (   of them--a stranger--came up to Pad after court, patted him on the) Tj
T* (   back and exclaimed enthusiastically, `Well done, Paddy!' Startled, Pad) Tj
T* (   just looked at him and then smiled. He had no idea how to respond to) Tj
T* (   the stranger.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Like the three Australian hackers, Pad, Gandalf and the little-known) Tj
T* (   Wandii were serving as the test case for new hacking laws in their) Tj
T* (   country. British law enforcement agencies had spent a fortune on the) Tj
T* (   case--more than [sterling]500000 according to the newspapers--by the) Tj
T* (   time the 8lgm case went to trial. This was going to be a show case,) Tj
T* (   and the government agencies wanted taxpayers to know they were getting) Tj
T* (   their money's worth.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The hackers weren't being charged with breaking into computers. They) Tj
T* (   were being charged with conspiracy, a more serious offence. While) Tj
T* (   admitting the threesome did not hack for personal gain, the) Tj
T* (   prosecution alleged the hackers had conspired to break into and modify) Tj
T* (   computer systems. It was a strange approach to say the least,) Tj
T* (   considering that none of the three hackers had ever met or even talked) Tj
T* (   to the others before they were arrested.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was not so strange, however, when looking at the potential) Tj
T* (   penalties. If the hackers had been charged with simply breaking into a) Tj
T* (   machine, without intending any harm, the maximum penalty was six) Tj
T* (   months jail and a fine of up to [sterling]5000. However, conspiracy,) Tj
T* (   which was covered under a different section of the Act, could bring up) Tj
T* (   to five years in jail and an unlimited amount in fines.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The prosecution was taking a big gamble. It would be harder to prove) Tj
T* (   conspiracy charges, which required demonstration of greater criminal) Tj
T* (   intent than lesser charges. The potential pay-off was of course also) Tj
T* (   much greater. If convicted, the defendants in Britain's most important) Tj
T* (   hacking case to date would be going to prison.) Tj

T* (   plausible defence to him, and he noticed Wandii looked very nervous in) Tj
T* (   court just after his plea.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad and Gandalf left London after their court appearance, returning to) Tj
T* (   the north to prepare for their sentencing hearings, and to watch the) Tj
T* (   progress of Wandii's case through the eyes of the media.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   They weren't disappointed. It was a star-studded show. The media) Tj
T* (   revved itself up for a feeding frenzy and the prosecution team, headed) Tj
T* (   by James Richardson, knew how to feed the pack. He zeroed in on) Tj
T* (   Wandii, telling the court how the schoolboy `was tapping into offices) Tj
T* (   at the EC in Luxembourg and even the experts were worried. He caused) Tj
T* (   havoc at universities all around the world'.4 To do this, Wandii had) Tj
T* (   used a simple BBC Micro computer, a Christmas present costing) Tj
T* (   [sterling]200.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The hacking didn't stop at European Community's computer, Richardson) Tj
T* (   told the eager crowd of journalists. Wandii had hacked Lloyd's, The) Tj
T* (   Financial Times and Leeds University. At The Financial Times machine,) Tj
T* (   Wandii's adventures had upset the smooth operations of the FTSE 100) Tj
T* (   share index, known in the City as `footsie'. The hacker installed a) Tj
T* (   scanning program in the FT's network, resulting in one outgoing call) Tj
T* (   made every second. The upshot of Wandii's intrusion: a [sterling]704) Tj
T* (   bill, the deletion of an important file and a management decision to) Tj
T* (   shut down a key system. With the precision of a banker, FT computer) Tj
T* (   boss Tony Johnson told the court that the whole incident had cost his) Tj
T* (   organisation [sterling]24871.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But the FT hack paled next to the prosecution's real trump card: The) Tj
T* (   European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer in) Tj
T* (   Brussels. They had been left with a [sterling]10000 phone bill as a) Tj
T* (   result of a scanner Wandii left on its machine,5 the court was told.) Tj
T* (   The scanner had left a trail of 50000 calls, all documented on a) Tj
T* (   980-page phone bill.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The scanner resulted in the system going down for a day, EORTC) Tj
T* (   information systems project manager Vincent Piedboeuf, told the jury.) Tj
T* (   He went on to explain that the centre needed its system to run 24) Tj
T* (   hours a day, so surgeons could register patients. The centre's) Tj
T* (   database was the focal point for pharmaceutical companies, doctors and) Tj
T* (   research centres--all coordinating their efforts in fighting the) Tj
T* (   disease.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   For the media, the case was headline heaven. `Teenage computer hacker) Tj
T* (   "caused worldwide chaos"' the Daily Telegraph screamed across page) Tj
T* (   one. On page three, the Daily Mail jumped in with `Teenage hacker) Tj
T* (   "caused chaos for kicks"'. Even The Times waded into the fray.) Tj
T* (   Smaller, regional newspapers pulled the story across the countryside) Tj
T* (   to the far reaches of the British Isles. The Herald in Glasgow told) Tj
T* (   its readers `Teenage hacker "ran up [sterling]10000 telephone bill"'.) Tj
T* (   Across the Irish Sea, the Irish Times caused a splash with its) Tj
T* (   headline, `Teenage hacker broke EC computer security'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Also in the first week of the case, The Guardian announced Wandii had) Tj
T* (   taken down the cancer centre database. By the time The Independent got) Tj
T* (   hold of the story, Wandii hadn't just shut down the database, he had) Tj
T* (   been reading the patients' most intimate medical details: `Teenager) Tj
T* (   "hacked into cancer patient files"'. Not to be outdone, on day four of) Tj
T* (   the trial, the Daily Mail had christened Wandii as a `computer) Tj

T* (   FT [sterling]25000'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The list went on. Wandii, the press announced, had hacked the Tokyo) Tj
T* (   Zoo and the White House. It was difficult to tell which was the more) Tj
T* (   serious offence.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Wandii's defence team had a few tricks of its own. Ian MacDonald, QC,) Tj
T* (   junior counsel Alistair Kelman and solicitor Deborah Tripley put) Tj
T* (   London University Professor James Griffith-Edwards, an authoritative) Tj
T* (   spokesman on addictive and compulsive behaviours, on the stand as an) Tj
T* (   expert witness. The chairman of the National Addiction Centre, the) Tj
T* (   professor had been part of a team which wrote the World Health) Tj
T* (   Organisation's definition of addiction. No-one was going to question) Tj
T* (   his qualifications.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The professor had examined Wandii and he announced his conclusion to) Tj
T* (   the court: Wandii was obsessed by computers, he was unable to stop) Tj
T* (   using them, and his infatuation made it impossible for him to choose) Tj
T* (   freely. `He repeated 12 times in police interviews, "I'm just) Tj
T* (   addicted. I wish I wasn't",' Griffith-Edwards told the court. Wandii) Tj
T* (   was highly intelligent, but was unable to escape from the urge to beat) Tj
T* (   computers' security systems at their own game. The hacker was obsessed) Tj
T* (   by the intellectual challenge. `This is the core ... of what attracts) Tj
T* (   the compulsive gambler,' the professor explained to the entranced jury) Tj
T* (   of three women and nine men.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But Wandii, this obsessive, addicted, gifted young man, had never had) Tj
T* (   a girlfriend, Griffith-Edwards continued. In fact, he shyly admitted) Tj
T* (   to the professor that he wouldn't even know how to ask a girl out. `He) Tj
T* (   [Wandii] became profoundly embarrassed when asked to talk about his) Tj
T* (   own feelings. He simply couldn't cope when asked what sort of person) Tj
T* (   he was.'6) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   People in the jury edged forward in their seats, concentrating) Tj
T* (   intently on the distinguished professor. And why wouldn't they? This) Tj
T* (   was amazing stuff. This erudite man had delved inside the mind of the) Tj
T* (   young man of bizarre contrasts. A man so sophisticated that he could) Tj
T* (   pry open computers belonging to some of Britain's and Europe's most) Tj
T* (   prestigious institutions, and yet at the same time so simple that he) Tj
T* (   had no idea how to ask a girl on a date. A man who was addicted not to) Tj
T* (   booze, smack or speed, which the average person associates with) Tj
T* (   addiction, but to a computer--a machine most people associated with) Tj
T* (   kids' games and word processing programs.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The defence proceeded to present vivid examples of Wandii's addiction.) Tj
T* (   Wandii's mother, a single parent and lecturer in English, had terrible) Tj
T* (   trouble trying to get her son away from his computer and modem. She) Tj
T* (   tried hiding his modem. He found it. She tried again, hiding it at his) Tj
T* (   grandmother's house. He burgled granny's home and retrieved it. His) Tj
T* (   mother tried to get at his computer. He pushed her out of his attic) Tj
T* (   room and down the stairs.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then he ran up a [sterling]700 phone bill as a result of his hacking.) Tj
T* (   His mother switched off the electricity at the mains. Her son) Tj
T* (   reconnected it. She installed a security calling-code on the phone to) Tj
T* (   stop him calling out. He broke it. She worried he wouldn't go out and) Tj
T* (   do normal teenage things. He continued to stay up all night--and) Tj
T* (   sometimes all day--hacking. She returned from work to find him) Tj
T* (   unconscious--sprawled across the living room floor and looking as) Tj
T* (   though he was dead. But it wasn't death, only sheer exhaustion. He) Tj

T* (   hacked until he passed out, then he woke up and hacked some more.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The stories of Wandii's self-confessed addiction overwhelmed, appalled) Tj
T* (   and eventually engendered pity in the courtroom audience. The media) Tj
T* (   began calling him `the hermit hacker'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Wandii's defence team couldn't fight the prosecution's) Tj
T* (   evidence head-on, so they took the prosecution's evidence and claimed) Tj
T* (   it as their own. They showed the jury that Wandii hadn't just hacked) Tj
T* (   the institutions named by the prosecution; he had hacked far, far more) Tj
T* (   than that. He didn't just hack a lot--he hacked too much. Most of all,) Tj
T* (   Wandii's defence team gave the jury a reason to acquit the) Tj
T* (   innocent-faced young man sitting before them.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   During the trial, the media focused on Wandii, but didn't completely) Tj
T* (   ignore the other two hackers. Computer Weekly hunted down where) Tj
T* (   Gandalf was working and laid it bare on the front page. A member of) Tj
T* (   `the UK's most notorious hacking gang', the journal announced, had) Tj
T* (   been working on software which would be used at Barclay's Bank.7 The) Tj
T* (   implication was clear. Gandalf was a terrible security risk and should) Tj
T* (   never be allowed to do any work for a financial institution. The) Tj
T* (   report irked the hackers, but they tried to concentrate on preparing) Tj
T* (   for their sentencing hearing.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   From the beginning of their case, the hackers had problems obtaining) Tj
T* (   certain evidence. Pad and Gandalf believed some of the material seized) Tj
T* (   in the police raids would substantially help their case--such as) Tj
T* (   messages from admins thanking them for pointing out security holes on) Tj
T* (   their systems. This material had not been included in the) Tj
T* (   prosecution's brief. When the defendants requested access to it, they) Tj
T* (   were refused access on the grounds that there was classified data on) Tj
T* (   the optical disk. They were told to go read the Attorney-General's) Tj
T* (   guidelines on disclosure of information. The evidence of the hackers') Tj
T* (   forays into military and government systems was jumbled in with their) Tj
T* (   intrusions into computers such as benign JANET systems, the defence) Tj
T* (   team was told. It would take too much time to separate the two.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Eventually, after some wrangling, Pad and Gandalf were told they could) Tj
T* (   inspect and copy material--provided it was done under the supervision) Tj
T* (   of the police. The hackers travelled to London, to Holborn police) Tj
T* (   station, to gather supporting evidence for their case. However, it) Tj
T* (   soon became clear that this time-consuming exercise would be) Tj
T* (   impossible to manage on an ongoing basis. Finally, the Crown) Tj
T* (   Prosecution Service relented, agreeing to release the material on disk) Tj
T* (   to Pad's solicitor, on the proviso that no copies were made, it did) Tj
T* (   not leave the law office, and it was returned at the end of the trial.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As Wandii's case lurched from revelation to exaggeration, Pad and) Tj
T* (   Gandalf busily continued to prepare for their own sentencing hearing.) Tj
T* (   Every day, Gandalf travelled from Liverpool to Manchester to meet with) Tj
T* (   his friend. They picked up a handful of newspapers at the local agent,) Tj
T* (   and then headed up to Pad's lawyer's office. After a quick scan for) Tj
T* (   articles covering the hacking case, the two hackers began sifting) Tj
T* (   through the reluctantly released prosecution disks. They read through) Tj
T* (   the material on computer, under the watchful eye of the law office's) Tj
T* (   cashier--the most computer literate person in the firm.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After fifteen days in the Southwark courtroom listening to fantastic) Tj
T* (   stories from both sides about the boy sitting before them, the jury in) Tj
T* (   Wandii's trial retired to consider the evidence. Before they left,) Tj

T* (   Judge Harris gave them a stern warning: the argument that Wandii was) Tj
T* (   obsessed or dependent was not a defence against the charges.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It took the jurors only 90 minutes to reach a decision, and when the) Tj
T* (   verdict was read out the courtroom erupted with a wave of emotion.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Not guilty. On all counts.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Wandii's mother burst into a huge smile and turned to her son, who was) Tj
T* (   also smiling. And the defence team couldn't be happier. Kelman told) Tj
T* (   journalists, `The jury felt this was a sledge hammer being used to) Tj
T* (   crack a nut'.8) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The prosecution was stunned and the law enforcement agents) Tj
T* (   flabbergasted. Detective Sergeant Barry Donovan found the verdict) Tj
T* (   bizarre. No other case in his 21 years in law enforcement had as much) Tj
T* (   overwhelming evidence as this one, yet the jury had let Wandii walk.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   And in a high-pitched frenzy rivalling its earlier hysteria, the) Tj
T* (   British media jumped all over the jury's decision. `Hacker who ravaged) Tj
T* (   systems walks free', an indignant Guardian announced. `Computer Genius) Tj
T* (   is cleared of hacking conspiracy', said the Evening Standard. `Hacking) Tj
T* (   "addict" acquitted', sniffed The Times. Overpowering them all was the) Tj
T* (   Daily Telegraph's page one: `Teenage computer addict who hacked White) Tj
T* (   House system is cleared'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then came the media king-hit. Someone had leaked another story and it) Tj
T* (   looked bad. The report, in the Mail on Sunday, said that the three) Tj
T* (   hackers had broken into a Cray computer at the European Centre for) Tj
T* (   Medium Range Weather Forecasting at Bracknell. This computer, likes) Tj
T* (   dozens of others, would normally have been relegated to the long list) Tj
T* (   of unmentioned victims except for one thing. The US military used) Tj
T* (   weather data from the centre for planning its attack on Iraq in the) Tj
T* (   Gulf War. The media report claimed that the attack had slowed down the) Tj
T* (   Cray's calculations, thus endangering the whole Desert Storm) Tj
T* (   operation. The paper announced the hackers had been `inadvertently) Tj
T* (   jeopardising--almost fatally--the international effort against Saddam) Tj
T* (   Hussein' and had put `thousands of servicemen's lives at risk'.9) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Further, the paper alleged that the US State Department was so) Tj
T* (   incensed about British hackers' repeated break-ins disrupting Pentagon) Tj
T* (   defence planning that it had complained to Prime Minister John Major.) Tj
T* (   The White House put the matter more bluntly than the State Department:) Tj
T* (   Stop your hackers or we will cut off European access to our satellite) Tj
T* (   which provides trans-Atlantic data and voice telecommunications.) Tj
T* (   Someone in Britain seemed to be listening, for less than twelve months) Tj
T* (   later, authorities had arrested all three hackers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad thought the allegations were rubbish. He had been inside a VAX) Tj
T* (   machine at the weather centre for a couple of hours one night, but he) Tj
T* (   had never touched a Cray there. He had certainly never done anything) Tj
T* (   to slow the machine down. No cracking programs, no scanners, nothing) Tj
T* (   which might account for the delay described in the report. Even if he) Tj
T* (   had been responsible, he found it hard to believe the Western allies') Tj
T* (   victory in the Gulf War was determined by one computer in Berkshire.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   All of which gave him cause to wonder why the media was running this) Tj
T* (   story now, after Wandii's acquittal but before he and Gandalf were) Tj

T* (   For days, columnists, editorial and letter writers across Britain) Tj
T* (   pontificated on the meaning of the Wandii's verdict and the validity) Tj
T* (   of an addiction to hacking as a defence. Some urged computer owners to) Tj
T* (   take responsibility for securing their own systems. Others called for) Tj
T* (   tougher hacking laws. A few echoed the view of The Times, which) Tj
T* (   declared in an editorial, `a persistent car thief of [the hacker's]) Tj
T* (   age would almost certainly have received a custodial sentence. Both) Tj
T* (   crimes suggest disrespect for other people's property ... the jurors) Tj
T* (   may have failed to appreciate the seriousness of this kind of) Tj
T* (   offence'.10) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The debate flew forward, changing and growing, and expanding beyond) Tj
T* (   Britain's borders. In Hong Kong, the South China Morning Post asked,) Tj
T* (   `Is [this] case evidence of a new social phenomenon, with immature and) Tj
T* (   susceptible minds being damaged through prolonged exposure to personal) Tj
T* (   computers?' The paper described public fear that Wandii's case would) Tj
T* (   result in `the green light for an army of computer-literate hooligans) Tj
T* (   to pillage the world's databases at will, pleading insanity when) Tj
T* (   caught'.11) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   By April Fool's Day 1991, more than two weeks after the end of the) Tj
T* (   court case, Wandii had his own syndrome named after him, courtesy of) Tj
T* (   The Guardian.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   And while Wandii, his mother and his team of lawyers celebrated their) Tj
T* (   victory quietly, the media reported that the Scotland Yard detectives) Tj
T* (   commiserated over their defeat, which was considerably more serious) Tj
T* (   than simply losing the Wandii case. The Computer Crimes Unit was being) Tj
T* (   `reorganised'. Two experienced officers from the five-man unit were) Tj
T* (   being moved out of the group. The official line was that the) Tj
T* (   `rotations' were normal Scotland Yard procedure. The unofficial word) Tj
T* (   was that the Wandii case had been a fiasco, wasting time and money,) Tj
T* (   and the debacle was not to be repeated.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In the north, a dark cloud gathered over Pad and Gandalf as their) Tj
T* (   judgment day approached. The Wandii case verdict might have been cause) Tj
T* (   for celebration among some in the computer underground, but it brought) Tj
T* (   little joy for the other two 8lgm hackers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   For Pad and Gandalf, who had already pleaded guilty, Wandii's) Tj
T* (   acquittal was a disaster.) Tj

T* (   With an impatient wave of his hand, Kayser asked the judge to dispense) Tj

T* (   had begun taking things from the family home. Electron didn't care) Tj
T* (   much because there were only two things he really wanted: that ring) Tj
T* (   and some of his father's paintings.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Kayser called a handful of witnesses to support the case for a light) Tj
T* (   sentence. Electron's grandmother from Queensland. The family friend) Tj
T* (   who had driven Electron to the hospital the day his father died.) Tj
T* (   Electron's psychiatrist, the eminent Lester Walton. Walton in) Tj
T* (   particular highlighted the difference between the two possible paths) Tj
T* (   forward: prison, which would certainly traumatise an already mentally) Tj
T* (   unstable young man, or freedom, which offered Electron a good chance) Tj
T* (   of eventually establishing a normal life.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Kayser began summarising the case for a non-custodial sentence,) Tj
T* (   Electron could hear the pack of journalists off to his side) Tj
T* (   frantically scribbling notes. He wanted to look at them, but he was) Tj
T* (   afraid the judge would see his ponytail, carefully tucked into his) Tj
T* (   neatly ironed white shirt, if he turned sideways,) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Your Honour,' Kayser glanced backward slightly, toward the court) Tj
T* (   reporters, as he warmed up, `my client lived in an artificial world of) Tj
T* (   electronic pulses.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Scratch, scribble. Electron could almost predict, within half a) Tj
T* (   second, when the journalists' pencils and pens would reach a crescendo) Tj
T* (   of activity. The ebb and flow of Boris's boom was timed in the style) Tj
T* (   of a TV newsreader.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Kayser said his client was addicted to the computer the way an) Tj
T* (   alcoholic was obsessed with the bottle. More scratching, and lots of) Tj
T* (   it. This client, Kayser thundered, had never sought to damage any) Tj
T* (   system, steal money or make a profit. He was not malicious in the) Tj
T* (   least, he was merely playing a game.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I think,' Electron's barrister concluded passionately, but slowly) Tj
T* (   enough for every journalist to get it down on paper, `that he should) Tj
T* (   have been called Little Jack Horner, who put in his thumb, pulled out) Tj
T* (   a plumb and said, "What a good boy am I!"') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Now came the wait. The judge retired to his chambers to weigh up the) Tj
T* (   pre-sentence report, Electron's family situation, the fact that he had) Tj
T* (   turned Crown witness, his offences--everything. Electron had given a) Tj
T* (   nine-page written statement against Phoenix to the prosecution. If the) Tj
T* (   Phoenix case went to trial, Electron would be put on the stand to back) Tj
T* (   up that statement.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In the month before Electron returned to court to hear his sentence,) Tj
T* (   he thought about how he could have fought the case. Some of the) Tj
T* (   charges were dubious.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In one case, he had been charged with illegally accessing public) Tj
T* (   information through a public account. He had accessed the anonymous) Tj
T* (   FTP server at the University of Helsinki to copy information about) Tj
T* (   DES. His first point of access had been through a hacked Melbourne) Tj
T* (   University account.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Beat that charge, Electron's lawyer had told him, and there's plenty) Tj
T* (   more where that came from. The DPP had good pickings and could make up) Tj
T* (   a new charge for another site. Still, Electron reasoned some of the) Tj
T* (   Crown's evidence would not have stood up under cross-examination.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When reporters from Australia and overseas called NASA headquarters) Tj
T* (   for comment on the hacker-induced network shutdown, the agency) Tj
T* (   responded that it had no idea what they were talking about. There had) Tj
T* (   been no NASA network shutdown. A spokesman made inquiries and, he) Tj
T* (   assured the media, NASA was puzzled by the report. Sharon Beskenis's) Tj
T* (   statement didn't seem so watertight after all. She was not, it turned) Tj
T* (   out, even a NASA employee but a contractor from Lockheed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   During that month-long wait, Electron had trouble living down Kayser's) Tj
T* (   nursery-rhyme rendition in the courtroom. When he rang friends, they) Tj
T* (   would open the conversation saying, `Oh, is that Little Jack Horner?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   They had all seen the nightly news, featuring Kayser and his client.) Tj
T* (   Kayser had looked grave leaving court, while Electron, wearing John) Tj
T* (   Lennon-style glasses with dark lenses and with his shoulder-length) Tj
T* (   curls pulled tightly back in a ponytail, had tried to smile at the) Tj
T* (   camera crews. But his small, fine features and smattering of freckles) Tj
T* (   disappeared under the harsh camera lights, so much so that the black,) Tj
T* (   round spectacles seemed almost to float on a blank, white surface.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The week after Electron pleaded guilty in Australia, Pad and Gandalf) Tj
T* (   sat side by side in London's Southwark dock one last time.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   For a day and a half, beginning on 20 May 1993, the two hackers) Tj
T* (   listened to their lawyers argue their defence. Yes, our clients hacked) Tj
T* (   computers, they told the judge, but the offences were nowhere near as) Tj
T* (   serious as the prosecution wants to paint them. The lawyers were) Tj
T* (   fighting hard for one thing: to keep Pad and Gandalf out of prison.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Some of the hearing was tough going for the two hackers, but not just) Tj
T* (   because of any sense of foreboding caused by the judge's imminent) Tj
T* (   decision. The problem was that Gandalf made Pad laugh, and it didn't) Tj
T* (   look at all good to laugh in the middle of your sentencing hearing.) Tj
T* (   Sitting next to Gandalf for hours on end, while lawyers from both) Tj
T* (   sides butchered the technical aspects of computer hacking which the) Tj
T* (   8lgm hackers had spent years learning, did it. Pad had only to give) Tj
T* (   Gandalf a quick sidelong glance and he quickly found himself) Tj
T* (   swallowing and clearing his throat to keep from bursting into) Tj
T* (   laughter. Gandalf's irrepressible irreverence was written all over his) Tj
T* (   face.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The stern-faced Judge Harris could send them to jail, but he still) Tj
T* (   wouldn't understand. Like the gaggle of lawyers bickering at the front) Tj
T* (   of the courtroom, the judge was--and would always be--out of the loop.) Tj

T* (   None of them had any idea what was really going on inside the heads of) Tj
T* (   the two hackers. None of them could ever understand what hacking was) Tj
T* (   all about--the thrill of stalking a quarry or of using your wits to) Tj
T* (   outsmart so-called experts; the pleasure of finally penetrating a) Tj
T* (   much-desired machine and knowing that system is yours; the deep) Tj
T* (   anti-establishment streak which served as a well-centred ballast) Tj
T* (   against the most violent storms washing in from the outside world; and) Tj
T* (   the camaraderie of the international hacking community on Altos.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The lawyers could talk about it, could put experts on the stand and) Tj
T* (   psychological reports in the hands of the judge, but none of them) Tj
T* (   would ever really comprehend because they had never experienced it.) Tj
T* (   The rest of the courtroom was out of the loop, and Pad and Gandalf) Tj
T* (   stared out from the dock as if looking through a two-way mirror from a) Tj
T* (   secret, sealed room.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad's big worry had been this third charge--the one which he faced) Tj
T* (   alone. At his plea hearing, he had admitted to causing damage to a) Tj
T* (   system owned by what was, in 1990, called the Polytechnic of Central) Tj
T* (   London. He hadn't damaged the machine by, say, erasing files, but the) Tj
T* (   other side had claimed that the damages totalled about [sterling]250) Tj
T* (   000.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The hacker was sure there was zero chance the polytechnic had spent) Tj
T* (   anything near that amount. He had a reasonable idea of how long it) Tj
T* (   would take someone to clean up his intrusions. But if the prosecution) Tj
T* (   could convince a judge to accept that figure, the hacker might be) Tj
T* (   looking at a long prison term.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad had already braced himself for the possibility of prison. His) Tj
T* (   lawyer warned him before the sentencing date that there was a) Tj
T* (   reasonable likelihood the two 8lgm hackers would be sent down. After) Tj
T* (   the Wandii case, the public pressure to `correct' a `wrong' decision) Tj
T* (   by the Wandii jury was enormous. The police had described Wandii's) Tj
T* (   acquittal as `a licence to hack'--and The Times, had run the) Tj
T* (   statement.12 It was likely the judge, who had presided over Wandii's) Tj
T* (   trial, would want to send a loud and clear message to the hacking) Tj
T* (   community.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad thought that perhaps, if he and Gandalf had pleaded not guilty) Tj
T* (   alongside Wandii, they would have been acquitted. But there was no way) Tj
T* (   Pad would have subjected himself to the kind of public humiliation) Tj
T* (   Wandii went through during the `addicted to computers' evidence. The) Tj
T* (   media appeared to want to paint the three hackers as pallid, scrawny,) Tj
T* (   socially inept, geeky geniuses, and to a large degree Wandii's lawyers) Tj
T* (   had worked off this desire. Pad didn't mind being viewed as highly) Tj
T* (   intelligent, but he wasn't a geek. He had a casual girlfriend. He went) Tj
T* (   out dancing with friends or to hear bands in Manchester's thriving) Tj
T* (   alternative music scene. He worked out his upper body with weights at) Tj
T* (   home. Shy--yes. A geek--no.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Could Pad have made a case for being addicted to hacking? Yes,) Tj
T* (   although he never believed that he had been. Completely enthralled,) Tj
T* (   entirely entranced? Maybe. Suffering from a passing obsession?) Tj
T* (   Perhaps. But addicted? No, he didn't think so. Besides, who knew for) Tj
T* (   sure if a defence of addiction could have saved him from the) Tj
T* (   prosecution's claim anyway?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Exactly where the quarter of a million pound claim came from in the) Tj
T* (   first place was a mystery to Pad. The police had just said it to him,) Tj

T* (   as if it was fact, in the police interview. Pad hadn't seen any proof,) Tj
T* (   but that hadn't stopped him from spending a great deal of time feeling) Tj
T* (   very stressed about how the judge would view the matter.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The only answer seemed to be some good, independent technical advice.) Tj
T* (   At the request of both Pad and Gandalf's lawyers, Dr Peter Mills, of) Tj
T* (   Manchester University, and Dr Russell Lloyd, of London Business) Tj
T* (   School, had examined a large amount of technical evidence presented in) Tj
T* (   the prosecution's papers. In an independent report running to more) Tj
T* (   than 23 pages, the experts stated that the hackers had caused less) Tj
T* (   havoc than the prosecution alleged. In addition, Pad's solicitor asked) Tj
T* (   Dr Mills to specifically review, in a separate report, the evidence) Tj
T* (   supporting the prosecution's large damage claim.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Dr Mills stated that one of the police expert witnesses, a British) Tj
T* (   Telecom employee, had said that Digital recommended a full rebuild of) Tj
T* (   the system at the earliest possible opportunity--and at considerable) Tj
T* (   cost. However, the BT expert had not stated that the cost was) Tj
T* (   [sterling]250000 nor even mentioned if the cost quote which had been) Tj
T* (   given had actually been accepted.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In fact, Dr Mills concluded that there was no supporting evidence at) Tj
T* (   all for the quarter of a million pound claim. Not only that, but any) Tj
T* (   test of reason based on the evidence provided by the prosecution) Tj
T* (   showed the claim to be completely ridiculous.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In a separate report, Dr Mills' stated that:) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   i\) The machine concerned was a Vax 6320, this is quite a powerful) Tj
T* (   `mainframe' system and could support several hundreds of users.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   ii\) That a full dump of files takes 6 tapes, however since the type of) Tj
T* (   tape is not specified this gives no real indication of the size of the) Tj
T* (   filesystem. A tape could vary from 0.2 Gigabytes to 2.5 Gigabytes.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   iii\) The machine was down for three days.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   With this brief information it is difficult to give an accurate cost) Tj
T* (   for restoring the machine, however an over estimate would be:) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   i\) Time spent in restoring the system, 10 man days at [sterling]300) Tj
T* (   per day; [sterling]3000.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   ii\) Lost time by users, 30 man days at [sterling]300 per day;) Tj
T* (   [sterling]9000.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The total cost in my opinion is unlikely to be higher than) Tj
T* (   [sterling]12000 and this itself is probably a rather high estimate. I) Tj
T* (   certainly cannot see how a figure of [sterling]250000 could be) Tj
T* (   justified.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It looked to Pad that the prosecution's claim was not for damage at) Tj
T* (   all. It was for properly securing the system--an entirely rebuilt) Tj
T* (   system. It seemed to him that the police were trying to put the cost) Tj
T* (   of securing the polytechnic's entire computer network onto the) Tj
T* (   shoulders of one hacker--and to call it damages. In fact, Pad) Tj
T* (   discovered, the polytechnic had never actually even spent the) Tj
T* (   [sterling]250000.) Tj

T* (   in his bed at night worrying about it. And, in the end, the figure put) Tj
T* (   forward for so long as fact was nothing but an outrageous claim based) Tj
T* (   on not a single shred of solid evidence.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Using Dr Mills's report, Pad's barrister, Mukhtar Hussain, QC,) Tj
T* (   negotiated privately with the prosecution barrister, who finally) Tj
T* (   relented and agreed to reduce the damage estimate to [sterling]15000.) Tj
T* (   It was, in Pad's view, still far too high, but it was much better than) Tj
T* (   [sterling]250000. He was in no mind to look a gift horse in the mouth.) Tj

T* (   Judge Harris accepted the revised damage estimate.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The prosecution may have lost ground on the damage bill, but it wasn't) Tj
T* (   giving up the fight. These two hackers, James Richardson told the) Tj
T* (   court and journalists during the two-day sentencing hearing, had) Tj
T* (   hacked into some 10000 computer systems around the world. They were) Tj
T* (   inside machines or networks in at least fifteen countries. Russia.) Tj
T* (   India. France. Norway. Germany. The US. Canada. Belgium. Sweden.) Tj
T* (   Italy. Taiwan. Singapore. Iceland. Australia. Officers on the case) Tj
T* (   said the list of the hackers' targets `read like an atlas', Richardson) Tj
T* (   told the court.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad listened to the list. It sounded about right. What didn't sound) Tj
T* (   right were the allegations that he or Gandalf had crashed Sweden's) Tj
T* (   telephone network by running an X.25 scanner over its packet network.) Tj
T* (   The crash had forced a Swedish government minister to apologise on) Tj
T* (   television. The police said the minister did not identify the true) Tj
T* (   cause of the problem--the British hackers--in his public apology.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad had no idea what they were talking about. He hadn't done anything) Tj
T* (   like that to the Swedish phone system, and as far as he knew, neither) Tj
T* (   had Gandalf.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Something else didn't sound right. Richardson told the court that in) Tj
T* (   total, the two hackers had racked up at least [sterling]25000 in phone) Tj
T* (   bills for unsuspecting legitimate customers, and caused `damage' to) Tj
T* (   systems which was very conservatively estimated at almost) Tj
T* (   [sterling]123000.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Where were these guys getting these numbers from? Pad marvelled at) Tj
T* (   their cheek. He had been through the evidence with a fine-toothed) Tj
T* (   comb, yet he had not seen one single bill showing what a site had) Tj
T* (   actually paid to repair `damage' caused by the hackers. The figures) Tj
T* (   tossed around by the police and the prosecution weren't real bills;) Tj
T* (   they weren't cast in iron.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Finally, on Friday 21 May, after all the evidence had been presented,) Tj
T* (   the judge adjourned the court to consider sentencing. When he returned) Tj
T* (   to the bench fifteen minutes later, Pad knew what was going to happen) Tj
T* (   from the judge's face. To the hacker, the expression said: I am going) Tj
T* (   to give you everything that Wandii should have got.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Judge Harris echoed The Times's sentiments when he told the two) Tj

T* (   would have called your conduct delinquent, and I don't shrink from the) Tj
T* (   analogy of describing what you were doing as intellectual joyriding.) Tj

T* (   protect society's computer systems and he would be failing in his) Tj

T* (   cells facing onto an open centre and prisoners only allowed out of) Tj
T* (   their cells for scheduled events such as time in the yard. It was a) Tj
T* (   place where hard-core criminals lived. Fortunately, Pad and Gandalf) Tj
T* (   had been placed in the same cell while they waited to be assigned to) Tj
T* (   their final destination.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Like any prison, Kirkham had its share of prisoners who didn't get) Tj
T* (   along with each other. Mostly, prisoners wanted to know what you were) Tj
T* (   in for and, more particularly, if you had been convicted of a sex) Tj
T* (   crime. They didn't like sex crime offenders and Pad heard about a pack) Tj
T* (   of Kirkham prisoners who dragged one of their own, screaming, to a) Tj
T* (   tree, where they tried to hang him for being a suspected rapist. In) Tj
T* (   fact, the prisoner hadn't been convicted of anything like rape. He had) Tj
T* (   simply refused to pay his poll tax.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Fortunately for Pad and Gandalf, everyone else in Kirkham knew why) Tj

T* (   room one afternoon to find a sign painted above their door. It said,) Tj
T* (   `NASA HQ'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The other minimum security prisoners understood hacking--and they had) Tj
T* (   all sorts of ideas about how you could make money from it. Most of the) Tj
T* (   prisoners in Kirkham were in for petty theft, credit card fraud, and) Tj
T* (   other small-time crimes. There was also a phreaker, who arrived the) Tj
T* (   same day as Pad and Gandalf. He landed eight months in prison--two) Tj
T* (   more than the 8lgm hackers--and Pad wondered what kind of message that) Tj
T* (   sent the underground.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Despite their best efforts, the 8lgm twosome didn't fit quite the) Tj
T* (   prison mould. In the evenings, other prisoners spent their free time) Tj
T* (   shooting pool or taking drugs. In the bedroom down the hall, Gandalf) Tj
T* (   lounged on his bed studying a book on VMS internals. Pad read a) Tj
T* (   computer magazine and listened to some indie music--often his `Babes) Tj
T* (   in Toyland' tape. In a parody of prison movies, the two hackers marked) Tj
T* (   off their days inside the prison with cross-hatched lines on their) Tj
T* (   bedroom wall--four marks, then a diagonal line through them. They) Tj
T* (   wrote other things on the walls too.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The long, light-filled days of summer flowed one into the other, as) Tj
T* (   Pad and Gandalf fell into the rhythm of the prison. The morning) Tj
T* (   check-in at 8.30 to make sure none of the prisoners had gone) Tj
T* (   walkabout. The dash across the bowling green for a breakfast of beans,) Tj
T* (   bacon, eggs, toast and sausage. The walk to the greenhouses where the) Tj
T* (   two hackers had been assigned for work detail.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The work wasn't hard. A little digging in the pots. Weeding around the) Tj
T* (   baby lettuce heads, watering the green peppers and transplanting) Tj
T* (   tomato seedlings. When the greenhouses became too warm by late) Tj
T* (   morning, Pad and Gandalf wandered outside for a bit of air. They often) Tj
T* (   talked about girls, cracking crude, boyish jokes about women and) Tj
T* (   occasionally discussing their girlfriends more seriously. As the heat) Tj
T* (   settled in, they sat down, lounging against the side of the) Tj

T* (   relaxed sense of humour. But liking him wasn't the same as knowing) Tj

T* (   On 6 October 1993, Phoenix and Nom stood side by side in the dock for) Tj
T* (   sentencing. Wearing a stern expression, Judge Smith began by detailing) Tj
T* (   both the hackers' charges and the origin of The Realm. But after the) Tj
T* (   summary, the judge saved his harshest rebuke for Phoenix.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `There is nothing ... to admire about your conduct and every reason) Tj
T* (   why it should be roundly condemned. You pointed out [weaknesses] to) Tj
T* (   some of the system administrators ... [but] this was more a display of) Tj
T* (   arrogance and a demonstration of what you thought was your superiority) Tj
T* (   rather than an act of altruism on your part.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `You ... bragged about what you had done or were going to do ... Your) Tj
T* (   conduct revealed ... arrogance on your part, open defiance, and an) Tj
T* (   intention to the beat the system. [You] did cause havoc for a time) Tj
T* (   within the various targeted systems.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Although the judge appeared firm in his views while passing sentence,) Tj
T* (   behind the scenes he had agonised greatly over his decision. He had) Tj
T* (   attempted to balance what he saw as the need for deterrence, the) Tj
T* (   creation of a precedence for sentencing hacking cases in Australia,) Tj
T* (   and the individual aspects of this case. Finally, after sifting) Tj
T* (   through the arguments again and again, he had reached a decision.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I have no doubt that some sections of our community would regard) Tj
T* (   anything than a custodial sentence as less than appropriate. I share) Tj
T* (   that view. But after much reflection ... I have concluded that an) Tj
T* (   immediate term of imprisonment is unnecessary.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   as the judge ordered Phoenix to complete 500 hours of community) Tj

T* (   delicate curls around his shoulders.) Tj

T* (   without success. The friend, nervous, said he had to get the data to) Tj
T* (   an Adelaide journalist before the police could stop him. Mendax's) Tj

T* (   left. A week later, the Victorian CIB turned up and searched his room,) Tj
T* (   but found nothing. He married his girlfriend, an intelligent but) Tj
T* (   introverted and emotionally disturbed sixteen-year-old he had met) Tj
T* (   through a mutual friend in a gifted children's program. A year later) Tj
T* (   they had a child.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax made many of his friends through the computer community. He) Tj
T* (   found Trax easy to talk to and they often spent up to five hours on a) Tj
T* (   single phone call. Prime Suspect, on the other hand, was hard work on) Tj
T* (   the phone.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Quiet and introverted, Prime Suspect always seemed to run out of) Tj
T* (   conversation after five minutes. Mendax was himself naturally shy, so) Tj
T* (   their talks were often filled with long silences. It wasn't that) Tj
T* (   Mendax didn't like Prime Suspect, he did. By the time the three) Tj
T* (   hackers met in person at Trax's home in mid-1991, he considered Prime) Tj
T* (   Suspect more than just a fellow hacker in the tight-knit IS circle.) Tj
T* (   Mendax considered him a friend.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Prime Suspect was a boy of veneers. To most of the world, he appeared) Tj
T* (   to be a studious year 12 student bound for university from his upper) Tj
T* (   middle-class grammar school. The all-boys school never expected less) Tj
T* (   from its students and the possibility of attending a TAFE--a) Tj
T* (   vocational college--was never discussed as an option. University was) Tj
T* (   the object. Any student who failed to make it was quietly swept under) Tj
T* (   the carpet like some sort of distasteful food dropping.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Prime Suspect's own family situation did not mirror the veneer of) Tj
T* (   respectability portrayed by his school. His father, a pharmacist, and) Tj
T* (   his mother, a nurse, had been in the midst of an acrimonious divorce) Tj
T* (   battle when his father was diagnosed with terminal cancer. In this) Tj
T* (   bitter, antagonistic environment, the eight-year-old Prime Suspect was) Tj
T* (   delivered to his father's bedside in hospice for a rushed few moments) Tj
T* (   to bid him farewell.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Through much of his childhood and adolescence, Prime Suspect's mother) Tj
T* (   remained bitter and angry about life, and particularly her) Tj
T* (   impoverished financial situation. When he was eight, Prime Suspect's) Tj
T* (   older sister left home at sixteen, moved to Perth and refused to speak) Tj
T* (   to her mother. In some ways, Prime Suspect felt he was expected be) Tj
T* (   both child and de facto parent. All of which made him grow up faster) Tj
T* (   in some ways, but remain immature in others.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Prime Suspect responded to the anger around him by retreating into his) Tj
T* (   room. When he bought his first computer, an Apple IIe, at age thirteen) Tj
T* (   he found it better company than any of his relatives. The computers at) Tj
T* (   school didn't hold much interest for him, since they weren't connected) Tj
T* (   to the outside world via modem. After reading about BBSes in the Apple) Tj
T* (   Users' Society newsletter, he saved up for his own modem and soon) Tj
T* (   began connecting into various BBSes.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   School did, however, provide the opportunity to rebel, albeit) Tj
T* (   anonymously, and he conducted extensive pranking campaigns. Few) Tj
T* (   teachers suspected the quiet, clean-cut boy and he was rarely caught.) Tj
T* (   Nature had endowed Prime Suspect with the face of utter innocence.) Tj
T* (   Tall and slender with brown curly hair, his true character only showed) Tj
T* (   in the elfish grin which sometimes passed briefly across his baby) Tj
T* (   face. Teachers told his mother he was underachieving compared to his) Tj
T* (   level of intelligence, but had few complaints otherwise.) Tj

T* (   By year 10, he had become a serious hacker and was spending every) Tj
T* (   available moment at his computer. Sometimes he skipped school, and he) Tj
T* (   often handed assignments in late. He found it difficult to come up) Tj
T* (   with ever more creative excuses and sometimes he imagined telling his) Tj
T* (   teachers the truth. `Sorry I didn't get that 2000-word paper done but) Tj
T* (   I was knee-deep in NASA networks last night.' The thought made him) Tj
T* (   laugh.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He saw girls as a unwanted distraction from hacking. Sometimes, after) Tj
T* (   he chatted with a girl at a party, his friends would later ask him why) Tj
T* (   he hadn't asked her out. Prime Suspect shrugged it off. The real) Tj
T* (   reason was that he would rather get home to his computer, but he never) Tj
T* (   discussed his hacking with anyone at school, not even with Mentat.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A friend of Force's and occasional visitor to The Realm, Mentat was) Tj
T* (   two years ahead of Prime Suspect at school and in general couldn't be) Tj
T* (   bothered talking to so junior a hacker as Prime Suspect. The younger) Tj
T* (   hacker didn't mind. He had witnessed other hackers' indiscretions,) Tj
T* (   wanted no part of them and was happy to keep his hacking life private.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Before the Realm bust, Phoenix rang him up once at 2 a.m. suggesting) Tj
T* (   that he and Nom come over there and then. Woken by the call, Prime) Tj
T* (   Suspect's mother stood in the doorway to his bedroom, remonstrating) Tj
T* (   with him for letting his `friends' call at such a late hour. With) Tj
T* (   Phoenix goading him in one ear, and his mother chewing him out in the) Tj
T* (   other, Prime Suspect decided the whole thing was a bad idea. He said) Tj
T* (   no thanks to Phoenix, and shut the door on his mother.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He did, however, talk to Powerspike on the phone once in a while. The) Tj
T* (   older hacker's highly irreverent attitude and Porky Pig laugh appealed) Tj
T* (   to him. But other than those brief talks, Prime Suspect avoided) Tj
T* (   talking on the phone to people outside the International Subversives,) Tj
T* (   especially when he and Mendax moved into ever more sensitive military) Tj
T* (   computers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Using a program called Sycophant written by Mendax, the IS hackers had) Tj
T* (   been conducting massive attacks on the US military. They divided up) Tj
T* (   Sycophant on eight attack machines, often choosing university systems) Tj
T* (   at places like the Australian National University or the University of) Tj
T* (   Texas. They pointed the eight machines at the targets and fired.) Tj
T* (   Within six hours, the eight machines had assaulted thousands of) Tj
T* (   computers. The hackers sometimes reaped 100000 accounts each night.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Using Sycophant, they essentially forced a cluster of Unix machines in) Tj
T* (   a computer network to attack the entire Internet en masse.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   And that was just the start of what they were into. They had been in) Tj

T* (   Jersey. Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, California.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As the IS hackers reached a level of sophistication beyond anything) Tj
T* (   The Realm had achieved, they realised that progress carried) Tj
T* (   considerable risk and began to withdraw completely from the broader) Tj
T* (   Australian hacking community. Soon they had drawn a tight circle) Tj
T* (   around themselves. They talked only to each other.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Watching the Realm hackers go down hadn't deterred the next generation) Tj
T* (   of hackers. It had only driven them further underground.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In the spring of 1991, Prime Suspect and Mendax began a race to get) Tj
T* (   root on the US Department of Defense's Network Information Center) Tj
T* (   \(NIC\) computer--potentially the most important computer on the) Tj
T* (   Internet.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As both hackers chatted amiably on-line one night, on a Melbourne) Tj
T* (   University computer, Prime Suspect worked quietly in another screen to) Tj
T* (   penetrate ns.nic.ddn.mil, a US Department of Defense system closely) Tj
T* (   linked to NIC. He believed the sister system and NIC might `trust') Tj
T* (   each other--a trust he could exploit to get into NIC. And NIC did) Tj
T* (   everything.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   NIC assigned domain names--the `.com' or `.net' at the end of an email) Tj
T* (   address--for the entire Internet. NIC also controlled the US) Tj
T* (   military's own internal defence data network, known as MILNET.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   NIC also published the communication protocol standards for all of the) Tj
T* (   Internet. Called RFCs \(Request for Comments\), these technical) Tj
T* (   specifications allowed one computer on the Internet to talk to) Tj
T* (   another. The Defense Data Network Security Bulletins, the US) Tj
T* (   Department of Defense's equivalent of CERT advisories, came from the) Tj
T* (   NIC machine.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Perhaps most importantly, NIC controlled the reverse look-up service) Tj
T* (   on the Internet. Whenever someone connects to another site across the) Tj
T* (   Internet, he or she typically types in the site name--say,) Tj
T* (   ariel.unimelb.edu.au at the University of Melbourne. The computer then) Tj
T* (   translates the alphabetical name into a numerical address--the IP) Tj
T* (   address--in this case 128.250.20.3. All the computers on the Internet) Tj
T* (   need this IP address to relay the packets of data onto the final) Tj
T* (   destination computer. NIC decided how Internet computers would) Tj
T* (   translate the alphabetical name into an IP address, and vice versa.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   If you controlled NIC, you had phenomenal power on the Internet. You) Tj
T* (   could, for example, simply make Australia disappear. Or you could turn) Tj
T* (   it into Brazil. By pointing all Internet addresses ending in) Tj
T* (   `.au'--the designation for sites in Australia--to Brazil, you could) Tj
T* (   cut Australia's part of the Internet off from the rest of the world) Tj
T* (   and send all Australian Internet traffic to Brazil. In fact, by) Tj
T* (   changing the delegation of all the domain names, you could virtually) Tj
T* (   stop the flow of information between all the countries on the) Tj
T* (   Internet.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The only way someone could circumvent this power was by typing in the) Tj
T* (   full numerical IP address instead of a proper alphabetical address.) Tj
T* (   But few people knew the up-to-twelve-digit IP equivalent of their) Tj
T* (   alphabetical addresses, and fewer still actually used them.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Whenever one computer connects to another across the Net, both) Tj
T* (   machines go through a special meet-and-greet process. The receiving) Tj

T* (   a few questions. What's the name of the incoming machine?) Tj
T* (   Is that name allowed to connect to me? In what ways am I) Tj
T* (   programmed to `trust' that machine--to wave my normal security for) Tj
T* (   connections from that system?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The receiving computer answers these questions based in large part on) Tj
T* (   information provided by NIC. All of which means that, by controlling) Tj
T* (   NIC, you could make any computer on the Net `pose' as a machine) Tj
T* (   trusted by a computer you might want to hack. Security often depended) Tj
T* (   on a computer's name, and NIC effectively controlled that name.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Prime Suspect managed to get inside NIC's sister system, he told) Tj
T* (   Mendax and gave him access to the computer. Each hacker then began his) Tj
T* (   own attack on NIC. When Mendax finally got root on NIC, the power was) Tj
T* (   intoxicating. Prime Suspect got root at the same time but using a) Tj
T* (   different method. They were both in.) Tj

T* (   Inside NIC, Mendax began by inserting a backdoor--a method of getting) Tj
T* (   back into the computer at a later date in case an admin repaired the) Tj

T* (   on, if he telnetted into the system's Data Defense Network \(DDN\)) Tj

T* (   around the world.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax also penetrated MILNET's Security Coordination Center, which) Tj
T* (   collected reports on every possible security incident on a MILNET) Tj
T* (   computer. Those computers--largely TOPS-20s made by DEC--contained) Tj
T* (   good automatic security programs. Any number of out-of-the-ordinary) Tj
T* (   events would trigger an automatic security report. Someone logging) Tj
T* (   into a machine for too long. A large number of failed login attempts,) Tj
T* (   suggesting password guessing. Two people logging into the same account) Tj

T* (   read on. US military hackers had broken into MILNET systems, using) Tj
T* (   them for target practice, and no-one had bothered to tell the system) Tj
T* (   admin at the target site.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax couldn't believe it. The US military was hacking its own) Tj
T* (   computers. This discovery led to another, more disturbing, thought. If) Tj
T* (   the US military was hacking its own computers for practice, what was) Tj
T* (   it doing to other countries' computers?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As he quietly backed out of the system, wiping away his footprints as) Tj
T* (   he tip-toed away, Mendax thought about what he had seen. He was deeply) Tj
T* (   disturbed that any hacker would work for the US military.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Hackers, he thought, should be anarchists, not hawks.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In early October 1991, Mendax rang Trax and gave him the dial-up and) Tj
T* (   account details for NMELH1.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Trax wasn't much of a hacker, but Mendax admired his phreaking) Tj
T* (   talents. Trax was the father of phreaking in Australia and Trax's) Tj
T* (   Toolbox, his guide to the art of phreaking, was) Tj
T* (   legendary. Mendax thought Trax might find some interesting detailed) Tj
T* (   information inside the NorTel network on how to) Tj
T* (   control telephone switches.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Trax invented multi-frequency code phreaking. By sending special) Tj
T* (   tones--generated by his computer program--down the phone line, he) Tj
T* (   could control certain functions in the telephone exchange. Many) Tj
T* (   hackers had learned how to make free phone calls by charging the cost) Tj
T* (   to someone else or to calling cards, but Trax discovered how to make) Tj
T* (   phone calls which weren't charged to anyone. The calls weren't just) Tj
T* (   free; they were untraceable.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Trax wrote 48 pages on his discovery and called it The Australian) Tj
T* (   Phreakers Manual Volumes 1-7. But as he added more and more to the) Tj
T* (   manual, he became worried what would happen if he released it in the) Tj
T* (   underground, so he decided he would only show it to the other two) Tj
T* (   International Subversive hackers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He went on to publish The Advanced Phreaker's Manual,2 a second) Tj
T* (   edition of the manual, in The International Subversive, the) Tj
T* (   underground magazine edited by Mendax:) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   An electronic magazine, The International Subversive had a simple) Tj
T* (   editorial policy. You could only have a copy of the magazine if you) Tj
T* (   wrote an `article'. The policy was a good way of protecting against) Tj
T* (   nappies--sloppy or inexperienced hackers who might accidentally draw) Tj
T* (   police attention. Nappies also tended to abuse good phreaking and) Tj
T* (   hacking techniques, which might cause Telecom to close up security) Tj
T* (   holes. The result was that IS had a circulation of just three people.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   To a non-hacker, IS looked like gobbledygook--the phone book made more) Tj
T* (   interesting reading. But to a member of the computer underground, IS) Tj
T* (   was a treasure map. A good hacker could follow the trail of modem) Tj
T* (   phone numbers and passwords, then use the directions in IS to) Tj
T* (   disappear through secret entrances into the labyrinth of forbidden) Tj
T* (   computer networks. Armed with the magazine, he could slither out of) Tj

T* (   However, Joe was just an average user. He didn't have root, which is) Tj
T* (   what Mendax wanted. But like every other user on the system, Joe had a) Tj
T* (   user identity number. Mendax changed Joe's user id to `0'--the magic) Tj
T* (   number. A user with `0' as his id had root. Joe had just acquired) Tj

T* (   There were still a few footprints to be cleaned up. The next time Joe) Tj
T* (   logged in, he would wonder why the computer didn't ask for his) Tj
T* (   password. And he might be surprised to discover he had been) Tj
T* (   transformed into a super-user. So Mendax used his super-user status to) Tj
T* (   delete the Trojan ETC file and return the original one to its proper) Tj
T* (   place. He also erased records showing he had ever logged in as Joe.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   To make sure he could login with super-user privileges in future,) Tj

T* (   corporate Internet which had been squashed flat as a pancake.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax had seen many flat structures before, but never on this scale.) Tj
T* (   It was bizarre. In hierarchical structures, it is easier to tell where) Tj

T* (   this structure, where every system was virtually equal, was going to) Tj

T* (   The NorTel network was firewalled, which meant that there was) Tj

T* (   made it more vulnerable to hackers who managed to get in through) Tj
T* (   dial-ups. It appeared that security on the NorTel network was) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was fantastic, this huge, trusting network of computer sites at) Tj

T* (   Too many hackers in Telecom? Now that was funny. Here was a hacker) Tj
T* (   reading the sensitive mail of NorTel's computer security expert who) Tj
T* (   reckoned Telecom's network was too exposed. In fact, Mendax had) Tj
T* (   penetrated Telecom's systems from NorTel's CORWAN, not the other way) Tj
T* (   round.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Perhaps to prove the point, Mendax decided to crack passwords to the) Tj
T* (   NorTel system. He collected 1003 password files from the NorTel sites,) Tj
T* (   pulled up his password cracking program, THC, and started hunting) Tj
T* (   around the network for some spare computers to do the job for him. He) Tj
T* (   located a collection of 40 Sun computers, probably housed in Canada,) Tj

T* (   THC ran very fast on those Sun4s. The program used a 60000 word) Tj
T* (   dictionary borrowed from someone in the US army who had done a thesis) Tj
T* (   on cryptography and password cracking. It also relied on `a) Tj
T* (   particularly nice fast-crypt algorithm' being developed by a) Tj
T* (   Queensland academic, Eric Young. The THC program worked about 30 times) Tj
T* (   faster than it would have done using the standard algorithm.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Using all 40 computers, Mendax was throwing as many as 40000 guesses) Tj
T* (   per second against the password lists. A couple of the Suns went down) Tj
T* (   under the strain, but most held their place in the onslaught. The) Tj
T* (   secret passwords began dropping like flies. In just a few hours,) Tj
T* (   Mendax had cracked 5000 passwords, some 100 of which were to root) Tj
T* (   accounts. He now had access to thousands of NorTel computers across) Tj
T* (   the globe.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   There were some very nice prizes to be had from these systems. Gain) Tj
T* (   control over a large company's computer systems and you virtually) Tj
T* (   controlled the company itself. It was as though you could walk through) Tj
T* (   every security barrier unchecked, beginning with the front door. Want) Tj
T* (   each employee's security codes for the office's front door? There it) Tj
T* (   was--on-line.) Tj

T* (   How about access to the company's payroll records? You could see how) Tj
T* (   much money each person earns. Better still, you might like to make) Tj
T* (   yourself an employee and pay yourself a tidy once-off bonus through) Tj
T* (   electronic funds transfer. Of course there were other, less obvious,) Tj
T* (   ways of making money, such as espionage.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax could have easily found highly sensitive information about) Tj
T* (   planned NorTel products and sold them. For a company like NorTel,) Tj
T* (   which spent more than $1 billion each year on research and) Tj
T* (   development, information leaks about its new technologies could be) Tj
T* (   devastating. The espionage wouldn't even have to be about new) Tj
T* (   products; it could simply be about the company's business strategies.) Tj
T* (   With access to all sorts of internal memos between senior executives,) Tj
T* (   a hacker could procure precious inside information on markets and) Tj
T* (   prices. A competitor might pay handsomely for this sort of) Tj
T* (   information.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   And this was just the start of what a malicious or profit-motivated) Tj
T* (   hacker could do. In many companies, the automated aspects of) Tj
T* (   manufacturing plants are controlled by computers. The smallest changes) Tj
T* (   to the programs controlling the machine tools could destroy an entire) Tj
T* (   batch of widgets--and the multi-million dollar robotics machinery) Tj
T* (   which manufactures them.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But the IS hackers had no intention of committing information) Tj
T* (   espionage. In fact, despite their poor financial status as students) Tj
T* (   or, in the case of Trax, as a young man starting his career at the) Tj
T* (   bottom of the totem pole, none of them would have sold information) Tj
T* (   they gained from hacking. In their view, such behaviour was dirty and) Tj
T* (   deserving of contempt--it soiled the adventure and was against their) Tj
T* (   ethics. They considered themselves explorers, not paid corporate) Tj
T* (   spies.) Tj

T* (   outside electronic world was very restricted, but it looked) Tj
T* (   interesting. The only problem was how to get there.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax began hunting around for a doorway. His password cracking) Tj
T* (   program had not turned up anything for this system, but there were) Tj
T* (   other, more subtle ways of getting a password than the brute force of) Tj
T* (   a cracking program.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   System administrators sometimes sent passwords through email. Normally) Tj
T* (   this would be a major security risk, but the NorTel system was) Tj
T* (   firewalled from the Internet, so the admins thought they had no real) Tj
T* (   reason to be concerned about hackers. Besides, in such a large) Tj
T* (   corporation spanning several continents, an admin couldn't always just) Tj
T* (   pop downstairs to give a new company manager his password in person.) Tj
T* (   And an impatient manager was unlikely to be willing to wait a week for) Tj
T* (   the new password to arrive courtesy of snail mail.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In the NorTel network, a mail spool, where email was stored, was often) Tj
T* (   shared between as many as twenty computer systems. This structure) Tj
T* (   offered considerable advantages for Mendax. All he needed to do was) Tj
T* (   break into the mail spool and run a keyword search through its) Tj
T* (   contents. Tell the computer to search for word combinations such as) Tj
T* (   `BNRGATE' and `password', or to look for the name of the system admin) Tj
T* (   for BNRGATE, and likely as not it would deliver tender morsels of) Tj
T* (   information such as new passwords.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax used a password he found through this method to get into) Tj
T* (   BNRGATE and look around. The account he was using only had very) Tj
T* (   restricted privileges, and he couldn't get root on the system. For) Tj
T* (   example, he could not FTP files from outside the NorTel network in the) Tj
T* (   normal way. Among Internet users FTP \(file transfer protocol\) is both) Tj
T* (   a noun and a verb: to FTP a program is to slurp a copy of it off one) Tj
T* (   computer site into your own. There is nothing illegal about FTP-ing) Tj
T* (   something per se, and millions of people across the Internet do so) Tj
T* (   quite legitimately.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It appeared to Mendax that the NorTel network admins allowed most) Tj
T* (   users to FTP something from the Internet, but prevented them from) Tj
T* (   taking the copied file back to their NorTel computer site. It was) Tj
T* (   stored in a special holding pen in) Tj
T* (   BNRGATE and, like quarantine officers, the system admins would) Tj
T* (   presumably come along regularly and inspect the contents to make sure) Tj
T* (   there were no hidden viruses or Trojans which hackers might use to) Tj
T* (   sneak into the network from the Internet.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   However, a small number of accounts on BNRGATE had fewer restrictions.) Tj
T* (   Mendax broke into one of these accounts and went out to the Internet.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   People from the Internet were barred from entering the NorTel network) Tj
T* (   through BNRGATE. However, people inside NorTel could go out to the) Tj
T* (   Internet via telnet.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Hackers had undoubtedly tried to break into NorTel through BNRGATE.) Tj
T* (   Dozens, perhaps hundreds, had unsuccessfully flung themselves against) Tj
T* (   BNRGATE's huge fortifications. To a hacker, the NorTel network was) Tj
T* (   like a medieval castle and the) Tj
T* (   BNRGATE firewall was an impossible battlement. It was a particular) Tj
T* (   delight for Mendax to telnet out from behind this firewall into the) Tj
T* (   Internet. It was as if he was walking out from the castle, past the) Tj
T* (   guards and well-defended turrets, over the drawbridge and the moat,) Tj

T* (   The castle also offered the perfect protection for further hacking) Tj
T* (   activities. Who could chase him? Even if someone managed to follow him) Tj
T* (   through the convoluted routing system he might set up to pass through) Tj
T* (   a half dozen computer systems, the pursuer would never get past the) Tj

T* (   be any one of 60000 NorTel employees on any one of 11000 computer) Tj
T* (   systems.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax telnetted out to the Internet and explored a few sites,) Tj
T* (   including the main computer system of Encore, a large computer) Tj
T* (   manufacturer. He had seen Encore computers before inside at least one) Tj

T* (   American hacker who told Par he had read Theorem's mail.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Corrupt was intrigued by Mendax's extensive knowledge of different) Tj
T* (   computer systems. When he learned that the Australian hacker was) Tj
T* (   coming from inside the NorTel firewall, he was impressed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The hackers began talking regularly, often when Mendax was coming from) Tj
T* (   inside NorTel. The black street fighter from inner-city Brooklyn and) Tj
T* (   the white intellectual from a leafy outer Melbourne suburb bridged the) Tj
T* (   gap in the anonymity of cyberspace. Sometime during their) Tj
T* (   conversations Corrupt must have decided that Mendax was a worthy) Tj
T* (   hacker, because he gave Mendax a few stolen passwords to Cray) Tj
T* (   accounts.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In the computer underground in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a Cray) Tj
T* (   computer account had all the prestige of a platinum charge card. The) Tj
T* (   sort of home computer most hackers could afford at that time had all) Tj
T* (   the grunt of a golf cart engine, but a Cray was the Rolls-Royce of) Tj
T* (   computers. Crays were the biggest, fastest computers in the world.) Tj
T* (   Institutions such as large universities would shell out millions of) Tj
T* (   dollars on a Cray so the astronomy or physics departments could solve) Tj
T* (   enormous mathematical problems in a fraction of the time it would take) Tj
T* (   on a normal computer. A Cray never sat idle overnight or during) Tj
T* (   holiday periods. Cray time was billed out by the minute. Crays were) Tj
T* (   elite.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Best of all, Crays were master password crackers. The computer would) Tj
T* (   go through Mendax's entire password cracking dictionary in just ten) Tj
T* (   seconds. An encrypted password file would simply melt like butter in a) Tj
T* (   fire. To a hacker, it was a beautiful sight, and Corrupt handing a few) Tj
T* (   Cray accounts over to Mendax was a friendly show of mutual respect.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax reciprocated by offering Corrupt a couple of accounts on) Tj
T* (   Encore. The two hackers chatted off and on and even tried to get) Tj
T* (   Corrupt into NorTel. No luck. Not even two of the world's most notable) Tj
T* (   hackers, working in tandem 10 000 miles apart, could get Corrupt) Tj
T* (   through the firewall. The two hackers talked now and again, exchanging) Tj
T* (   information about what their respective feds were up to and sharing) Tj
T* (   the occasional account on interesting systems.) Tj

T* (   The flat structure of the NorTel network created a good challenge) Tj

T* (   were in high spirits about their adventures.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then, one balmy spring night, things changed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax logged into NMELH1 about 2.30 a.m. As usual, he began by) Tj
T* (   checking the logs which showed what the system operators had been) Tj
T* (   doing. Mendax did this to make sure the NorTel officials were not onto) Tj
T* (   IS and were not, for example, tracing the telephone call.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Something was wrong. The logs showed that a NorTel system admin had) Tj
T* (   stumbled upon one of their secret directories of files about an hour) Tj
T* (   ago. Mendax couldn't figure out how he had found the files, but this) Tj
T* (   was very serious. If the admin realised there was a hacker in the) Tj
T* (   network he might call the AFP.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax used the logs of the korn shell, called KSH, to secretly watch) Tj
T* (   what the admin was doing. The korn shell records the history of) Tj
T* (   certain user activities. Whenever the admin typed a command into the) Tj
T* (   computer, the KSH stored what had been typed in the history file.) Tj
T* (   Mendax accessed that file in such a way that every line typed by the) Tj
T* (   admin appeared on his computer a split second later.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The admin began inspecting the system, perhaps looking for signs of an) Tj
T* (   intruder. Mendax quietly deleted his incriminating directory. Not) Tj
T* (   finding any additional clues, the admin decided to inspect the) Tj
T* (   mysterious directory more closely. But the directory had disappeared.) Tj
T* (   The admin couldn't believe his eyes. Not an hour before there had been) Tj
T* (   a suspicious-looking directory in his system and now it had simply) Tj
T* (   vanished. Directories didn't just dissolve into thin air. This was a) Tj
T* (   computer--a logical system based on 0s and 1s. It didn't make) Tj
T* (   decisions to delete directories.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A hacker, the admin thought. A hacker must have been in the NorTel) Tj
T* (   system and deleted the directory. Was he in the system now? The admin) Tj
T* (   began looking at the routes into the system.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The admin was connected to the system from his home, but he wasn't) Tj
T* (   using the same dial-up lines as the hacker. The admin was connected) Tj
T* (   through Austpac, Telecom's commercial X.25 data network. Perhaps the) Tj
T* (   hacker was also coming in through the X.25 connection.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax watched the admin inspect all the system users coming on over) Tj
T* (   the X.25 network. No sign of a hacker. Then the admin checked the logs) Tj
T* (   to see who else might have logged on over the past half hour or so.) Tj
T* (   Nothing there either.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The admin appeared to go idle for a few minutes. He was probably) Tj
T* (   staring at his computer terminal in confusion. Good, thought Mendax.) Tj
T* (   Stumped. Then the admin twigged. If he couldn't see the hacker's) Tj
T* (   presence on-line, maybe he could see what he was doing on-line. What) Tj
T* (   programs was the hacker running? The admin headed straight for the) Tj
T* (   process list, which showed all the programs being run on the computer) Tj
T* (   system.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax sent the admin a fake error signal. It appears to the admin as) Tj
T* (   if his korn shell had crashed. The admin re-logged in and headed) Tj
T* (   straight for the process list again.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Some people never learn, Mendax thought as he booted the admin off) Tj

T* (   ) Tj

T* (   off once more, this time by freezing up his computer screen.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   This game of cat and mouse went on for some time. As long as the admin) Tj
T* (   was doing what Mendax considered to be normal system administration) Tj

T* (   Then, at 3.30 a.m., something utterly unexpected happened. The admin) Tj
T* (   reappeared, except this time he wasn't logged in from home over the) Tj
T* (   X.25 network. He was sitting at the console, the master terminal) Tj
T* (   attached to the computer system at NorTel's Melbourne office. Mendax) Tj
T* (   couldn't believe it. The admin had got in his car in the middle of the) Tj
T* (   night and driven into the city just to get to the bottom of the) Tj
T* (   mystery.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax knew the game was up. Once the system operator was logged in) Tj
T* (   through the computer system's console, there was no way to kick him) Tj
T* (   off the system and keep him off. The roles were reversed and the) Tj
T* (   hacker was at the mercy of the admin. At the console, the system admin) Tj
T* (   could pull the plug to the whole system. Unplug every modem. Close) Tj
T* (   down every connection to other networks. Turn the computer off. The) Tj
T* (   party was over.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When the admin was getting close to tracking down the hacker, a) Tj
T* (   message appeared on his screen. This message did not appear with the) Tj
T* (   usual headers attached to messages sent from one system user to) Tj
T* (   another. It just appeared, as if by magic, in the middle of the) Tj
T* (   admin's screen:) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (                      I have finally become sentient.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The admin stopped dead in his tracks, momentarily giving up his) Tj
T* (   frantic search for the hacker to contemplate this first contact with) Tj
T* (   cyberspace intelligence. Then another anonymous message, seemingly) Tj
T* (   from the depths of the computer system itself, appeared on his screen:) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (                           I have taken control.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (            For years, I have been struggling in this greyness.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (                   But now I have finally seen the light.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The admin didn't respond. The console was idle.) Tj

T* (   Sitting alone at his Amiga in the dark night on the outskirts of the) Tj

T* (   one. If he knew which line the hacker was using, he could simply turn) Tj
T* (   off the modem. Or request a trace on the line.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax sent another anonymous message to the admin's computer screen:) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (                  It's been nice playing with your system.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (     We didn't do any damage and we even improved a few things. Please) Tj
T* (                 don't call the Australian Federal Police.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The admin ignored the message and continued his search for the hacker.) Tj
T* (   He ran a program to check which telephone lines were active on the) Tj
T* (   system's serial ports, to reveal which dial-up lines were in use. When) Tj
T* (   the admin saw the carrier detect sign on the line being used by the) Tj
T* (   hacker, Mendax decided it was time to bail out. However, he wanted to) Tj
T* (   make sure that his call had not been traced, so he lifted the receiver) Tj
T* (   of his telephone, disconnected his modem and waited for the NorTel) Tj
T* (   modem to hang up first.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   If the NorTel admin had set up a last party recall trace to determine) Tj
T* (   what phone number the hacker was calling from, Mendax would know. If) Tj
T* (   an LPR trace had been installed, the NorTel end of the telephone) Tj
T* (   connection would not disconnect but would wait for the hacker's) Tj
T* (   telephone to hang up first. After 90 seconds, the exchange would log) Tj
T* (   the phone number where the call had originated.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   If, however, the line did not have a trace on it, the company's modem) Tj
T* (   would search for its lost connection to the hacker's modem. Without) Tj
T* (   the continuous flow of electronic signals, the NorTel modem would hang) Tj
T* (   up after a few seconds. If no-one reactivated the line at the NorTel) Tj
T* (   end, the connection would time-out 90 seconds later and the telephone) Tj
T* (   exchange would disconnect the call completely.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax listened anxiously as the NorTel modem searched for his modem) Tj
T* (   by squealing high-pitched noises into the telephone line. No modem) Tj
T* (   here. Go on, hang up.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Suddenly, silence.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   OK, thought Mendax. Just 90 seconds to go. Just wait here for a minute) Tj
T* (   and a half. Just hope the exchange times out. Just pray there's no) Tj
T* (   trace.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then someone picked up the telephone at the NorTel end. Mendax) Tj
T* (   started. He heard several voices, male and female, in the background.) Tj
T* (   Jesus. What were these NorTel people on about? Mendax was so quiet he) Tj
T* (   almost stopped breathing. There was silence at the receivers on both) Tj
T* (   ends of that telephone line. It was a tense waiting game. Mendax heard) Tj
T* (   his heart racing.) Tj

T* (   Mendax sat frozen at his desk as his mind replayed the events of the) Tj

T* (   was lucky he had escaped unidentified. NorTel had discovered him) Tj
T* (   before they could put a trace on the line, but the company would) Tj
T* (   almost certainly put a trace on the dial-up lines now. NorTel was very) Tj
T* (   tight with Telecom. If anyone could get a trace up quickly, NorTel) Tj
T* (   could. Mendax had to warn Prime Suspect and Trax.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   First thing in the morning, Mendax rang Trax and told him to stay away) Tj

T* (   had been installed? What if they had called in the Feds?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   manipulate the exchange in order to interrupt the call. There wasn't.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Trax, you're the master phreaker,' Mendax pleaded. `Do something.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Despite their best efforts, the detectives in the AFP's Southern) Tj
T* (   Region Computer Crimes Unit hadn't been able to determine who was) Tj
T* (   behind the attacks. They suspected it was a small group of) Tj
T* (   Melbourne-based hackers who worked together. However, there were so) Tj
T* (   much hacker activity at RMIT it was difficult to know for sure. There) Tj
T* (   could have been one organised group, or several. Or perhaps there was) Tj
T* (   one small group along with a collection of loners who were making) Tj
T* (   enough noise to distort the picture.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Still, it should have been a straightforward operation. The AFP could) Tj
T* (   trace hackers in this sort of situation with their hands tied behind) Tj
T* (   their backs. Arrange for Telecom to whack a last party recall trace on) Tj
T* (   all incoming lines to the RMIT modems. Wait for a hacker to logon,) Tj
T* (   then isolate which modem he was using. Clip that modem line and wait) Tj
T* (   for Telecom to trace that line back to its point of origin.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   However, things at RMIT were not working that way. The line traces) Tj
T* (   began failing, and not just occasionally. All the time.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Whenever RMIT staff found the hackers on-line, they clipped the lines) Tj
T* (   and Telecom began tracking the winding path back to the originating) Tj
T* (   phone number. En route, the trail went dead. It was as if the hackers) Tj
T* (   knew they were being traced ... almost as if they were manipulating) Tj
T* (   the telephone system to defeat the AFP investigation.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The next generation of hackers seemed to have a new-found) Tj
T* (   sophistication which frustrated AFP detectives at every turn. Then, on) Tj
T* (   13 October 1990, the AFP got lucky. Perhaps the hackers had been lazy) Tj
T* (   that day, or maybe they just had technical problems using their) Tj
T* (   traceless phreaking techniques. Prime Suspect couldn't use Trax's) Tj
T* (   traceless phreaking method from his home because he was on a) Tj
T* (   step-by-step exchange, and sometimes Trax didn't use the technique.) Tj
T* (   Whatever the reason, Telecom managed to successfully complete two line) Tj
T* (   traces from RMIT and the AFP now had two addresses and two names.) Tj
T* (   Prime Suspect and Trax.) Tj

T* (   spring, 1991, and the weather was unseasonably warm.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I did. Pretty amazing. RMIT looks like it will finally be getting rid) Tj
T* (   of those line traces.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   the AFP. I figure Geoff Huston must be giving him a hard time.') Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Prime Suspect hung up.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   And the AFP stayed on the line.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In the twelve months following the initial line trace in late 1990,) Tj
T* (   the AFP continued to monitor the RMIT dial-up lines. The line traces) Tj
T* (   kept failing again and again. But as new reports of hacker attacks) Tj
T* (   rolled in, there seemed to be a discernible pattern in many of the) Tj
T* (   attacks. Detectives began to piece together a picture of their prey.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In 1990 and 1991, RMIT dial-ups and computers were riddled with) Tj
T* (   hackers, many of whom used the university's systems as a nest--a place) Tj
T* (   to store files, and launch further attacks. They frolicked in the) Tj
T* (   system almost openly, often using RMIT as a place to chat on-line with) Tj
T* (   each other. The institute served as the perfect launchpad. It was only) Tj
T* (   a local phone call away, it had a live Internet connection, a) Tj
T* (   reasonably powerful set of computers and very poor security. Hacker) Tj
T* (   heaven.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The police knew this, and they asked computer staff to keep the) Tj
T* (   security holes open so they could monitor hacker activity. With) Tj
T* (   perhaps a dozen different hackers--maybe more--inside RMIT, the task) Tj
T* (   of isolating a single cell of two or three organised hackers) Tj
T* (   responsible for the more serious attacks was not going to be easy.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   By the middle of 1991, however, there was a growing reluctance among) Tj
T* (   some RMIT staff to continue leaving their computers wide open. On 28) Tj
T* (   August, Allan Young, the head of RMIT's Electronic Communications) Tj
T* (   Group, told the AFP that the institute wanted to close up the security) Tj
T* (   holes. The AFP did not like this one bit, but when they complained) Tj
T* (   Young told them, in essence, go talk to Geoff Huston at AARNET and to) Tj
T* (   the RMIT director.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The AFP was being squeezed out, largely because they had taken so long) Tj
T* (   conducting their investigation. RMIT couldn't reveal the AFP) Tj
T* (   investigation to anyone, so it was being embarrassed in front of) Tj
T* (   dozens of other research institutions which assumed it had no idea how) Tj
T* (   to secure its computers. Allan Young couldn't go to a conference with) Tj
T* (   other AARNET representatives without being hassled about `the hacker) Tj
T* (   problem' at RMIT. Meanwhile, his computer staff lost time playing) Tj
T* (   cops-and-robbers--and ignored their real work.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   However, as RMIT prepared to phase out the AFP traps, the police had a) Tj
T* (   lucky break from a different quarter--NorTel. On 16 September, a line) Tj
T* (   trace from a NorTel dial-up, initiated after a complaint about the) Tj
T* (   hackers to the police, was successful. A fortnight later, on 1) Tj
T* (   October, the AFP began tapping Prime Suspect's telephone. The hackers) Tj
T* (   might be watching the police watch them, but the police were closing) Tj
T* (   in. The taps led back to Trax, and then to someone new--Mendax.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The AFP considered putting taps on Mendax and Trax's telephones as) Tj
T* (   well. It was a decision to be weighed up carefully. Telephone taps) Tj
T* (   were expensive, and often needed to be in place for at least a month.) Tj
T* (   They did, however, provide a reliable record of exactly what the) Tj
T* (   hacker was doing on-line.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Before police could move on setting up additional taps in Operation) Tj
T* (   Weather, the plot took another dramatic turn when one of the IS) Tj
T* (   hackers did something which took the AFP completely by surprise.) Tj

T* (   driven him to Vermont for a swot-vac party. When she arrived back home) Tj

T* (   them, they had pushed past her, swarming into her home.) Tj

T* (   She told the police she wanted to make a phone call and tried to ring) Tj
T* (   her family solicitor, but without luck. He had been to a funeral and) Tj
T* (   wake and could not be roused. When she reached for the phone a second) Tj
T* (   time, one of the officers began lecturing her about making more phone) Tj
T* (   calls.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `You be quiet,' she said pointing her finger at the officer. Then she) Tj
T* (   made another unfruitful call.) Tj

T* (   This was her home. She would show the police to her son's room, as) Tj
T* (   they requested, but she was not going to allow them to take over the) Tj

T* (   of their window they saw a group of strange men in street clothes) Tj
T* (   brazenly taking things from the widow's home as if they owned the) Tj
T* (   place. So the neighbours did what any responsible person would in the) Tj
T* (   circumstances. They called the police.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The AFP officers sent the Victoria Police on their way. Then some of) Tj
T* (   them set off in a plain car for the Vermont party. Wanting to save) Tj
T* (   Prime Suspect some embarrassment in front of his friends, his mother) Tj
T* (   rang him at the party and suggested he wait outside for the AFP.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As soon as Prime Suspect hung up the phone he tried to shake off the) Tj
T* (   effect of a vast quantity of alcohol. When the police pulled up) Tj
T* (   outside, the party was in full swing. Prime Suspect was very drunk,) Tj
T* (   but he seemed to sober up quite well when the AFP officers introduced) Tj
T* (   themselves and packed him into the car.) Tj

T* (   are you more worried about? What's on your disks or what's in your) Tj
T* (   desk drawer?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Prime Suspect thought hard. What was in his desk drawer? Oh shit! The) Tj
T* (   dope. He didn't smoke much, just occasionally for fun, but he had a) Tj
T* (   tiny amount of marijuana left over from a party.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He didn't answer. He looked out the window and tried not to look) Tj
T* (   nervous.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I don't think so. I'm feeling a little ... under the weather at the) Tj

T* (   his thoughts. Then he remembered the dope. He opened his desk drawer.) Tj
T* (   It was still there. Funny people, these feds.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then again, maybe it made sense. Why would they bother with some tiny) Tj
T* (   amount of dope that was hardly worth the paperwork? His nervousness) Tj
T* (   over a couple of joints must have seemed laughable to the feds. They) Tj
T* (   had just seized enough evidence of hacking to lock him up for years,) Tj
T* (   depending on the judge, and here he was sweating about a thimbleful of) Tj
T* (   marijuana which might land him a $100 fine.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As the late spring night began to cool down, Prime Suspect wondered) Tj
T* (   whether the AFP had raided Mendax and Trax.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   At the party, before the police had shown up, he had tried to ring) Tj
T* (   Mendax. From his mother's description when she called him, it sounded) Tj
T* (   as if the entire federal police force was in his house at that moment.) Tj
T* (   Which could mean that only one other IS hacker had gone down at the) Tj
T* (   same time. Unless he was the last to be raided, Mendax or Trax might) Tj
T* (   still be unaware of what was happening.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As he waited for the police to pick him up, a very drunk Prime Suspect) Tj
T* (   tried to ring Mendax again. Busy. He tried again. And again. The) Tj
T* (   maddening buzz of an engaged signal only made Prime Suspect more) Tj
T* (   nervous.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   There was no way to get through, no way to warn him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Prime Suspect wondered whether the police had actually shown up at) Tj
T* (   Mendax's and whether, if he had been able to get through, his phone ) Tj
T* (   call would have made any difference at all.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (                                  [ ]) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The house looked like it had been ransacked. It had been ransacked, by) Tj
T* (   Mendax's wife, on her way out. Half the furniture was missing, and the) Tj
T* (   other half was in disarray. Dresser drawers hung open with their) Tj
T* (   contents removed, and clothing lay scattered around the room.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When his wife left him, she didn't just take their toddler child. She) Tj
T* (   took a number of things which had sentimental value to Mendax. When) Tj
T* (   she insisted on taking the CD player she had given him for his) Tj
T* (   twentieth birthday just a few months before, he asked her to leave a) Tj
T* (   lock of her hair behind for him in its place. He still couldn't) Tj
T* (   believe his wife of three years had packed up and left him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The last week of October had been a bad one for Mendax. Heartbroken,) Tj
T* (   he had sunk into a deep depression. He hadn't eaten properly for days,) Tj
T* (   he drifted in and out of a tortured sleep, and he had even lost the) Tj
T* (   desire to use his computer. His prized hacking disks, filled with) Tj
T* (   highly incriminating stolen computer access codes, were normally) Tj
T* (   stored in a secure hiding place. But on the evening of 29 October) Tj
T* (   1991, thirteen disks were strewn around his $700 Amiga 500. A) Tj
T* (   fourteenth disk was in the computer's disk drive.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax sat on a couch reading Soledad Brother, the prison) Tj
T* (   letters from George Jackson's nine-year stint in one of the toughest) Tj
T* (   prisons in the US. Convicted for a petty crime, Jackson was supposed) Tj
T* (   to be released after a short sentence but was kept in the prison at) Tj
T* (   the governor's pleasure. The criminal justice system kept him on a) Tj

T* (   feet. Later, prison guards shot and killed Jackson. The book was one) Tj
T* (   of Mendax's favourites, but it offered little distraction from his) Tj
T* (   unhappiness.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The droning sound of a telephone fault signal--like a busy) Tj
T* (   signal--filled the house. Mendax had hooked up his stereo speakers to) Tj
T* (   his modem and computer, effectively creating a speaker phone so he) Tj
T* (   could listen to tones he piped from his computer into the telephone) Tj
T* (   line and the ones which came back from the exchange in reply. It was) Tj
T* (   perfect for using Trax's MFC phreaking methods.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax also used the system for scanning. Most of the time, he picked) Tj
T* (   telephone prefixes in the Melbourne CBD. When his modem hit another,) Tj
T* (   Mendax would rush to his computer and note the telephone number for) Tj
T* (   future hacking exploration.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   By adjusting the device, he could also make it simulate a phreaker's) Tj
T* (   black box. The box would confuse the telephone exchange into thinking) Tj
T* (   he had not answered his phone, thus allowing Mendax's friends to call) Tj
T* (   him for free for 90 seconds.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   On this night, however, the only signal Mendax was sending out was) Tj
T* (   that he wanted to be left alone. He hadn't been calling any computer) Tj
T* (   systems. The abandoned phone, with no connection to a remote modem,) Tj
T* (   had timed out and was beeping off the hook.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was strange behaviour for someone who had spent most of his teenage) Tj
T* (   years trying to connect to the outside world through telephone lines) Tj
T* (   and computers, but Mendax had listened all day to the hypnotic sound) Tj
T* (   of a phone off the hook resonating through each room. BEEEP. Pause.) Tj
T* (   BEEEP. Pause. Endlessly.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A loud knock at the door punctured the stereo thrum of the phone.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax looked up from his book to see a shadowy figure through the) Tj
T* (   frosted glass panes of the front door. The figure was quite short. It) Tj
T* (   looked remarkably like Ratface, an old school friend of Mendax's wife) Tj
T* (   and a character known for his practical jokes.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax called out, `Who is it?' without moving from the sofa.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Police. Open up.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Yeah, sure. At 11.30 p.m.? Mendax rolled his eyes toward the door.) Tj
T* (   Everyone knew that the police only raid your house in the early) Tj
T* (   morning, when they know you are asleep and vulnerable.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax dreamed of police raids all the time. He dreamed of footsteps) Tj
T* (   crunching on the driveway gravel, of shadows in the pre-dawn darkness,) Tj
T* (   of a gun-toting police squad bursting through his backdoor at 5 a.m.) Tj
T* (   He dreamed of waking from a deep sleep to find several police officers) Tj
T* (   standing over his bed. The dreams were very disturbing. They) Tj
T* (   accentuated his growing paranoia that the police were watching him,) Tj
T* (   following him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The dreams had become so real that Mendax often became agitated in the) Tj
T* (   dead hour before dawn. At the close of an all-night hacking session,) Tj
T* (   he would begin to feel very tense, very strung out. It was not until) Tj
T* (   the computer disks, filled with stolen computer files from his hacking) Tj
T* (   adventures, were stored safely in their hiding place that he would) Tj

T* (   begin to calm down.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Go away, Ratface, I'm not in the mood,' Mendax said, returning to his) Tj
T* (   book.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The voice became louder, more insistent, `Police. Open the door. NOW'.) Tj
T* (   Other figures were moving around behind the glass, shoving police) Tj
T* (   badges and guns against the window pane. Hell. It really was the) Tj
T* (   police!) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax's heart started racing. He asked the police to show him their) Tj
T* (   search warrant. They obliged immediately, pressing it against the) Tj
T* (   glass as well. Mendax opened the door to find nearly a dozen) Tj
T* (   plain-clothes police waiting for him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I don't believe this,' he said in a bewildered voice `My wife just) Tj
T* (   left me. Can't you come back later?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   At the front of the police entourage was Detective Sergeant Ken Day,) Tj
T* (   head of the AFP's Computer Crimes Unit in the southern region. The two) Tj
T* (   knew all about each other, but had never met in person. Day spoke) Tj
T* (   first.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I'm Ken Day. I believe you've been expecting me.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax and his fellow IS hackers had been expecting the AFP. For weeks) Tj
T* (   they had been intercepting electronic mail suggesting that the police) Tj
T* (   were closing the net. So when Day turned up saying, `I believe you've) Tj
T* (   been expecting me,' he was completing the information circle. The) Tj
T* (   circle of the police watching the hackers watching the police watch) Tj
T* (   them.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It's just that Mendax didn't expect the police at that particular) Tj
T* (   moment. His mind was a tangle and he looked in disbelief at the band) Tj
T* (   of officers on his front step. Dazed, he looked at Day and then spoke) Tj
T* (   out loud, as if talking to himself, `But you're too short to be a) Tj
T* (   cop.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Day looked surprised. `Is that meant to be an insult?' he said.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It wasn't. Mendax was in denial and it wasn't until the police had) Tj
T* (   slipped past him into the house that the reality of the situation) Tj
T* (   slowly began to sink in. Mendax's mind started to work again.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The disks. The damn disks. The beehive.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   An avid apiarist, Mendax kept his own hive. Bees fascinated him. He) Tj
T* (   liked to watch them interact, to see their sophisticated social) Tj
T* (   structure. So it was with particular pleasure that he enlisted their) Tj
T* (   help in hiding his hacking activities. For months he had meticulously) Tj
T* (   secreted the disks in the hive. It was the ideal location--unlikely,) Tj
T* (   and well guarded by 60000 flying things with stings. Though he hadn't) Tj
T* (   bought the hive specifically for hiding stolen computer account) Tj
T* (   passwords for the likes of the US Air Force 7th Command Group in the) Tj
T* (   Pentagon, it appeared to be a secure hiding place.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He had replaced the cover of the super box, which housed the) Tj
T* (   honeycomb, with a sheet of coloured glass so he could watch the bees) Tj

T* (   the glass sheet with metal clasps. As Mendax considered his) Tj
T* (   improvements to the bee box, he realised that this hive could provide) Tj
T* (   more than honey. He carefully laid out the disks between the glass and) Tj
T* (   the weather protector. They fitted perfectly in the small gap.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax had even trained the bees not to attack him as he removed and) Tj
T* (   replaced the disks every day. He collected sweat from his armpits on) Tj
T* (   tissues and then soaked the tissues in a sugar water solution. He fed) Tj
T* (   this sweaty nectar to the bees. Mendax wanted the bees to associate) Tj
T* (   him with flowers instead of a bear, the bees' natural enemy.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But on the evening of the AFP raid Mendax's incriminating disks were) Tj
T* (   in full view on the computer table and the officers headed straight) Tj
T* (   for them. Ken Day couldn't have hoped for better evidence. The disks) Tj
T* (   were full of stolen userlists, encrypted passwords, cracked passwords,) Tj
T* (   modem telephone numbers, documents revealing security flaws in various) Tj
T* (   computer systems, and details of the AFP's own investigation--all from) Tj
T* (   computer systems Mendax had penetrated illegally.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax's problems weren't confined to the beehive disks. The last) Tj
T* (   thing he had done on the computer the day before was still on screen.) Tj
T* (   It was a list of some 1500 accounts, their passwords, the dates that) Tj
T* (   Mendax had obtained them and a few small notes beside each one.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The hacker stood to the side as the police and two Telecom Protective) Tj
T* (   Services officers swarmed through the house. They photographed his) Tj
T* (   computer equipment and gathered up disks, then ripped up the carpet so) Tj
T* (   they could videotape the telephone cord running to his modem. They) Tj
T* (   scooped up every book, no small task since Mendax was an avid reader,) Tj
T* (   and held each one upside down looking for hidden computer passwords on) Tj
T* (   loose pieces of paper. They grabbed every bit of paper with) Tj
T* (   handwriting on it and poured through his love letters, notebooks and) Tj
T* (   private diaries. `We don't care how long it takes to do this job,' one) Tj
T* (   cop quipped. `We're getting paid overtime. And danger money.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The feds even riffled through Mendax's collection of old Scientific) Tj
T* (   American and New Scientist magazines. Maybe they thought he had) Tj
T* (   underlined a word somewhere and turned it into a passphrase for an) Tj
T* (   encryption program.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Of course, there was only one magazine the feds really wanted:) Tj
T* (   International Subversive. They scooped up every print-out of the) Tj
T* (   electronic journal they could find.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As Mendax watched the federal police sift through his possessions and) Tj
T* (   disassemble his computer room, an officer who had some expertise with) Tj
T* (   Amigas arrived. He told Mendax to get the hell out of the computer) Tj
T* (   room.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax didn't want to leave the room. He wasn't under arrest and) Tj
T* (   wanted to make sure the police didn't plant anything. So he looked at) Tj
T* (   the cop and said, `This is my house and I want to stay in this room.) Tj
T* (   Am I under arrest or not?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The cop snarled back at him, `Do you want to be under arrest?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax acquiesced and Day, who was far more subtle in his approach,) Tj
T* (   walked the hacker into another room for questioning. He turned to) Tj
T* (   Mendax and asked, with a slight grin, `So, what's it like being) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax froze.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   There were only two ways that Day could have known Nom had told Mendax) Tj
T* (   about his bust. Nom might have told him, but this was highly unlikely.) Tj
T* (   Nom's hacking case had not yet gone to court and Nom wasn't exactly on) Tj
T* (   chummy terms with the police. The other alternative was that the AFP) Tj
T* (   had been tapping telephones in Mendax's circle of hackers, which the) Tj
T* (   IS trio had strongly suspected. Talking in a three-way phone) Tj
T* (   conversation with Mendax and Trax, Nom had relayed the story of his) Tj
T* (   bust. Mendax later relayed Nom's story to Prime Suspect--also on the) Tj
T* (   phone. Harbouring suspicions is one thing. Having them confirmed by a) Tj
T* (   senior AFP officer is quite another.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Day pulled out a tape recorder, put it on the table, turned it on and) Tj
T* (   began asking questions. When Mendax told Day he wouldn't answer him,) Tj
T* (   Day turned the recorder off. `We can talk off the record if you want,') Tj
T* (   he told the hacker.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax nearly laughed out loud. Police were not journalists. There was) Tj
T* (   no such thing as an off-the-record conversation between a suspect and) Tj
T* (   a police officer.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax asked to speak to a lawyer. He said he wanted to call) Tj
T* (   Alphaline, a free after-hours legal advice telephone service. Day) Tj
T* (   agreed, but when he picked up the telephone to inspect it before) Tj
T* (   handing it over to Mendax, something seemed amiss. The phone had an) Tj
T* (   unusual, middle-pitched tone which Day didn't seem to recognise.) Tj
T* (   Despite there being two Telecom employees and numerous police) Tj
T* (   specialists in the house, Day appeared unable to determine the cause) Tj
T* (   of the funny tone. He looked Mendax dead in the eye and said, `Is this) Tj
T* (   a hijacked telephone line?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Hijacked? Day's comment took Mendax by surprise. What surprised him) Tj
T* (   was not that Day suspected him of hijacking the line, but rather that) Tj
T* (   he didn't know whether the line had been manipulated.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Well, don't you know?' he taunted Day.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   For the next half hour, Day and the other officers picked apart) Tj
T* (   Mendax's telephone, trying to work out what sort of shenanigans the) Tj
T* (   hacker had been up to. They made a series of calls to see if the) Tj
T* (   long-haired youth had somehow rewired his telephone line, perhaps to) Tj
T* (   make his calls untraceable.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In fact, the dial tone on Mendax's telephone was the very normal sound) Tj
T* (   of a tone-dial telephone on an ARE-11 telephone exchange. The tone was) Tj
T* (   simply different from the ones generated by other exchange types, such) Tj
T* (   as AXE and step-by-step exchanges.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Finally Mendax was allowed to call a lawyer at Alphaline. The lawyer) Tj
T* (   warned the hacker not to say anything. He said the police could offer) Tj
T* (   a sworn statement to the court about anything the hacker said, and) Tj
T* (   then added that the police might even be wired.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Next, Day tried the chummy approach at getting information from the) Tj
T* (   hacker. `Just between you and me, are you Mendax?' he asked.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Silence.) Tj

T* (   Day tried another tactic. Hackers have a well-developed sense of) Tj
T* (   ego--a flaw Day no doubt believed he could tap into.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `There have been a lot of people over the years running around) Tj
T* (   impersonating you--using your handle,' he said.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax could see Day was trying to manipulate him but by this stage he) Tj
T* (   didn't care. He figured that the police already had plenty of evidence) Tj
T* (   that linked him to his handle, so he admitted to it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Day had some other surprising questions up his sleeve.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `So, Mendax, what do you know about that white powder in the bedroom?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax couldn't recall any white powder in the bedroom. He didn't do) Tj
T* (   drugs, so why would there be any white powder anywhere? He watched two) Tj
T* (   police officers bringing two large red toolboxes in the house--they) Tj
T* (   looked like drug testing kits. Jesus, Mendax thought. I'm being set) Tj
T* (   up.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The cops led the hacker into the bedroom and pointed to two neat lines) Tj
T* (   of white powder laid out on a bench.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax smiled, relieved. `It's not what you think,' he said. The white) Tj
T* (   powder was glow-in-the-dark glue he had used to paint stars on the) Tj
T* (   ceiling of his child's bedroom.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Two of the cops started smiling at each other. Mendax could see) Tj
T* (   exactly what was going through their minds: It's not every cocaine or) Tj
T* (   speed user that can come up with a story like that.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   One grinned at the other and exclaimed gleefully, `TASTE TEST!') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `That's not a good idea,' Mendax said, but his protests only made) Tj
T* (   things worse. The cops shooed him into another room and returned to) Tj
T* (   inspect the powder by themselves.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   What Mendax really wanted was to get word through to Prime Suspect.) Tj
T* (   The cops had probably busted all three IS hackers at the same time,) Tj
T* (   but maybe not. While the police investigated the glue on their own,) Tj
T* (   Mendax managed to sneak a telephone call to his estranged wife and) Tj
T* (   asked her to call Prime Suspect and warn him. He and his wife might) Tj
T* (   have had their differences, but he figured she would make the call) Tj
T* (   anyway.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Mendax's wife reached Prime Suspect later that night, he replied,) Tj
T* (   `Yeah, there's a party going on over here too.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax went back in to the kitchen where an officer was tagging the) Tj
T* (   growing number of possessions seized by the police. One of the female) Tj
T* (   officers was struggling to move his printer to the pile. She smiled) Tj
T* (   sweetly at Mendax and asked if he would move it for her. He obliged.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The police finally left Mendax's house at about 3 a.m. They had spent) Tj
T* (   three and half hours and seized 63 bundles of his personal belongings,) Tj
T* (   but they had not charged him with a single crime.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When the last of the unmarked police cars had driven away, Mendax) Tj
T* (   stepped out into the silent suburban street. He looked around. After) Tj

T* (   booth and rang Trax.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `The AFP raided my house tonight.' he warned his friend. `They just) Tj
T* (   left.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Trax sounded odd, awkward. `Oh. Ah. I see.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Is there something wrong? You sound strange,' Mendax said.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Ah. No ... no, nothing's wrong. Just um ... tired. So, um ... so the) Tj
T* (   feds could ... ah, be here any minute ...' Trax's voice trailed off.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But something was very wrong. The AFP were already at Trax's house,) Tj
T* (   and they had been there for 10 hours.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The IS hackers waited almost three years to be charged. The threat of) Tj
T* (   criminal charges hung over their heads like personalised Swords of) Tj
T* (   Damocles. They couldn't apply for a job, make a friend at TAFE or plan) Tj
T* (   for the future without worrying about what would happen as a result of) Tj
T* (   the AFP raids of 29 October 1991.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Finally, in July 1994, each hacker received formal charges--in the) Tj
T* (   mail. During the intervening years, all three hackers went through) Tj
T* (   monumental changes in their lives.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Devastated by the break-down of his marriage and unhinged by the AFP) Tj
T* (   raid, Mendax sank into a deep depression and consuming anger. By the) Tj
T* (   middle of November 1991, he was admitted to hospital.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He hated hospital, its institutional regimens and game-playing) Tj
T* (   shrinks. Eventually, he told the doctors he wanted out. He might be) Tj
T* (   crazy, but hospital was definitely making him crazier. He left there) Tj
T* (   and stayed at his mother's house. The next year was the worst of his) Tj
T* (   life.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Once a young person leaves home--particularly the home of a) Tj
T* (   strong-willed parent--it becomes very difficult for him or her to) Tj
T* (   return. Short visits might work, but permanent residency often fails.) Tj
T* (   Mendax lived for a few days at home, then went walkabout. He slept in) Tj
T* (   the open air, on the banks of rivers and creeks, in grassy) Tj
T* (   meadows--all on the country fringes of Melbourne's furthest suburbs.) Tj
T* (   Sometimes he travelled closer to the city, overnighting in places like) Tj
T* (   the Merri Creek reserve.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mostly, he haunted Sherbrooke Forest in the Dandenong Ranges National) Tj
T* (   Park. Because of the park's higher elevation, the temperature dropped) Tj
T* (   well below the rest of Melbourne in winter. In summer, the mosquitoes) Tj
T* (   were unbearable and Mendax sometimes woke to find his face swollen and) Tj
T* (   bloated from their bites.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   For six months after the AFP raid, Mendax didn't touch a computer.) Tj
T* (   Slowly, he started rebuilding his life from the ground up. By the time) Tj
T* (   the AFP's blue slips--carrying 29 charges--arrived in July 1994, he) Tj
T* (   was settled in a new house with his child. Throughout his period of) Tj
T* (   transition, he talked to Prime Suspect and Trax on the phone) Tj
T* (   regularly--as friends and fellow rebels, not fellow hackers. Prime) Tj
T* (   Suspect had been going through his own set of problems.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   While he hacked, Prime Suspect didn't do many drugs. A little weed,) Tj
T* (   not much else. There was no time for drugs, girls, sports or anything) Tj

T* (   else. After the raid, he gave up hacking and began smoking more dope.) Tj
T* (   In April 1992, he tried ecstasy for the first time--and spent the next) Tj
T* (   nine months trying to find the same high. He didn't consider himself) Tj
T* (   addicted to drugs, but the drugs had certainly replaced his addiction) Tj
T* (   to hacking and his life fell into a rhythm.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Snort some speed or pop an ecstasy tablet on Saturday night. Go to a) Tj
T* (   rave. Dance all night, sometimes for six hours straight. Get home) Tj
T* (   mid-morning and spend Sunday coming down from the drugs. Get high on) Tj
T* (   dope a few times during the week, to dull the edges of desire for the) Tj
T* (   more expensive drugs. When Saturday rolled around, do it all over) Tj
T* (   again. Week in, week out. Month after month.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Dancing to techno-music released him. Dancing to it on drugs cleared) Tj
T* (   his mind completely, made him feel possessed by the music. Techno was) Tj
T* (   musical nihilism; no message, and not much medium either. Fast,) Tj
T* (   repetitive, computer-synthesised beats, completely stripped of vocals) Tj
T* (   or any other evidence of humanity. He liked to go to techno-night at) Tj
T* (   The Lounge, a city club, where people danced by themselves, or in) Tj
T* (   small, loose groups of four or five. Everyone watched the video screen) Tj
T* (   which provided an endless stream of ever-changing, colourful) Tj
T* (   computer-generated geometric shapes pulsing to the beat.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Prime Suspect never told his mother he was going to a rave. He just) Tj
T* (   said he was going to a friend's for the night. In between the drugs,) Tj
T* (   he attended his computer science courses at TAFE and worked at the) Tj
T* (   local supermarket so he could afford his weekly $60 ecstasy tablet,) Tj
T* (   $20 rave entry fee and regular baggy of marijuana.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Over time, the drugs became less and less fun. Then, one Sunday, he) Tj
T* (   came down off some speed hard. A big crash. The worst he had ever) Tj
T* (   experienced. Depression set in, and then paranoia. He knew the police) Tj
T* (   were still watching him. They had followed him before.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   At his police interviews, he learned that an AFP officer had followed) Tj
T* (   him to an AC/DC concert less than two weeks before he had been busted.) Tj
T* (   The officer told him the AFP wanted to know what sort of friends Prime) Tj
T* (   Suspect associated with--and the officer had been treated to the spectre) Tj
T* (   of seven other arm-waving, head-thumping, screaming teenagers just like) Tj
T* (   Prime Suspect himself.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Now Prime Suspect believed that the AFP had started following him) Tj
T* (   again. They were going to raid him again, even though he had given up) Tj
T* (   hacking completely. It didn't make sense. He knew the premonition was) Tj
T* (   illogical, but he couldn't shake it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Something bad--very, very bad--was going to happen any day. Overcome) Tj
T* (   with a great sense of impending doom, he lapsed into a sort of) Tj
T* (   hysterical depression. Feeling unable to prevent the advent of the) Tj
T* (   dark, terrible event which would tear apart his life yet again, he) Tj
T* (   reached out to a friend who had experienced his own personal problems.) Tj
T* (   The friend guided him to a psychologist at the Austin Hospital. Prime) Tj
T* (   Suspect decided that there had to be a better way to deal with his) Tj
T* (   problems than wasting himself every weekend. He began counselling.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The counselling made him deal with all sorts of unresolved business.) Tj
T* (   His father's death. His relationship with his mother. How he had) Tj
T* (   evolved into an introvert, and why he was never comfortable talking to) Tj
T* (   people. Why he hacked. How he became addicted to hacking. Why he took) Tj
T* (   up drugs.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   At the end, the 21-year-old Prime Suspect emerged drug-free and,) Tj
T* (   though still shaky, on the road to recovery. The worst he had to wait) Tj
T* (   for were the charges from the AFP.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Trax's recovery from his psychological instabilities wasn't as) Tj
T* (   definitive. From 1985, Trax had suffered from panic attacks, but he) Tj
T* (   didn't want to seek professional help--he just ran away from the) Tj
T* (   problem. The situation only became worse after he was involved in a) Tj
T* (   serious car accident. He became afraid to leave the house at night. He) Tj
T* (   couldn't drive. Whenever he was in a car, he had to fight an) Tj
T* (   overwhelming desire to fling the door open and throw himself out on to) Tj
T* (   the road. In 1989, his local GP referred Trax to a psychiatrist, who) Tj
T* (   tried to treat the phreaker's growing anxiety attacks with hypnosis) Tj
T* (   and relaxation techniques.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Trax's illness degenerated into full-fledged agoraphobia, a fear of) Tj
T* (   open spaces. When he rang the police in late October 1991--just days) Tj
T* (   before the AFP raid--his condition had deteriorated to the point where) Tj
T* (   he could not comfortably leave his own house.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Initially he rang the state police to report a death threat made) Tj
T* (   against him by another phreaker. Somewhere in the conversation, he) Tj
T* (   began to talk about his own phreaking and hacking. He hadn't intended) Tj
T* (   to turn himself in but, well, the more he talked, the more he had to) Tj
T* (   say. So many things had been weighing on his mind. He knew that Prime) Tj
T* (   Suspect had probably been traced from NorTel as a result of Mendax's) Tj
T* (   own near miss in that system. And Prime Suspect and Mendax had been so) Tj
T* (   active, breaking into so many systems, it was almost as if they wanted) Tj
T* (   to be caught.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then there was Prime Suspect's plan to write a destructive worm, which) Tj
T* (   would wipe systems en route. It wasn't really a plan per se, more just) Tj
T* (   an idea he had toyed with on the phone. Nonetheless, it had scared) Tj
T* (   Trax. He began to think all three IS hackers were getting in too deep) Tj
T* (   and he wanted out.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He tried to stop phreaking, even going so far as to ask Telecom to) Tj
T* (   change his telephone number to a new exchange which he knew would not) Tj
T* (   allow him to make untraceable calls. Trax reasoned that if he knew he) Tj
T* (   could be traced, he would stop phreaking and hacking.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   For a period, he did stop. But the addiction was too strong, and) Tj
T* (   before long he was back at it again, regardless of the risk. He ran a) Tj
T* (   hidden cable from his sister's telephone line, which was on the old) Tj
T* (   exchange. His inability to stop made him feel weak and guilty, and) Tj
T* (   even more anxious about the risks. Perhaps the death threat threw him) Tj
T* (   over the edge. He couldn't really understand why he had turned himself) Tj
T* (   in to the police. It had just sort of happened.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The Victoria Police notified the AFP. The AFP detectives must have) Tj
T* (   been slapping their heads in frustration. Here was Australia's next) Tj
T* (   big hacker case after The Realm, and they had expected to make a clean) Tj
T* (   bust. They had names, addresses, phone numbers. They had jumped) Tj
T* (   through legal hoops to get a telephone tap. The tap was up and) Tj
T* (   running, catching every target computer, every plot, every word the) Tj
T* (   hackers said to each other. Then one of their targets goes and turns) Tj
T* (   himself in to the police. And not even to the right police--he goes to) Tj
T* (   the Victoria Police. In one fell swoop, the hacker was going to take) Tj
T* (   down the entire twelve-month Operation Weather investigation.) Tj

T* (   The AFP had to move quickly. If Trax tipped off the other two IS) Tj
T* (   hackers that he had called the police, they might destroy their notes,) Tj
T* (   computer files--all the evidence the AFP had hoped to seize in raids.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When the AFP swooped in on the three hackers, Mendax and Prime Suspect) Tj
T* (   had refused to be interviewed on the night. Trax, however, had spent) Tj
T* (   several hours talking to the police at his house.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He told the other IS hackers that the police had threatened to take) Tj
T* (   him down to AFP headquarters--despite the fact that they knew leaving) Tj
T* (   his house caused him anxiety. Faced with that prospect, made so) Tj
T* (   terrifying by his psychiatric illness, he had talked.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Prime Suspect and Mendax didn't know how much Trax had told the) Tj
T* (   police, but they didn't believe he would dob them in completely. Apart) Tj
T* (   from anything else, he hadn't been privy to much of his colleagues') Tj
T* (   hacking. They hadn't tried to exclude Trax, but he was not as) Tj
T* (   sophisticated a hacker and therefore didn't share in many of their) Tj
T* (   exploits.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In fact, one thing Trax did tell the police was just how sophisticated) Tj
T* (   the other two IS hackers had become just prior to the bust. Prime) Tj
T* (   Suspect and Mendax were, he said, `hackers on a major scale, on a huge) Tj
T* (   scale--something never achieved before', and the AFP had sat up and) Tj
T* (   taken notice.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After the raids, Trax told Mendax that the AFP had tried to recruit) Tj
T* (   him as an informant. Trax said that they had even offered him a new) Tj
T* (   computer system, but he had been non-committal. And it seemed the AFP) Tj
T* (   was still keeping tabs on the IS hackers, Trax also told Mendax. The) Tj
T* (   AFP officers had heard Mendax had gone into hospital and they were) Tj
T* (   worried. There seemed to be a disturbing pattern evolving.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   On the subject of the IS raids, Trax told Mendax that the AFP felt it) Tj
T* (   didn't have any choice. Their attitude was: you were doing so much, we) Tj
T* (   had to bust you. You were inside so many systems, it was getting out) Tj
T* (   of control.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In any case, by December 1991 Mendax had agreed to a police interview,) Tj
T* (   based on legal advice. Ken Day interviewed Mendax, and the hacker was) Tj
T* (   open with Day about what he had done. He refused, however, to) Tj
T* (   implicate either Trax or Prime Suspect. In February 1992, Prime) Tj
T* (   Suspect followed suit, with two interviews. He was also careful about) Tj
T* (   what he said regarding his fellow hackers. Mendax was interviewed a) Tj
T* (   second time, in February 1992, as was Trax in August.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After the raid, Trax's psychiatric condition remained unstable. He) Tj
T* (   changed doctors and began receiving home visits from a hospital) Tj
T* (   psychiatric service. Eventually, a doctor prescribed medication.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The three hackers continued to talk on the phone, and see each other) Tj
T* (   occasionally. One or the other might drop out of communication for a) Tj
T* (   period, but would soon return to the fold. They helped each other and) Tj
T* (   they maintained their deep anti-establishment sentiments.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After the charges arrived in the mail, they called each other to) Tj
T* (   compare notes. Mendax thought out loud on the phone to Prime Suspect,) Tj
T* (   `I guess I should get a lawyer'.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `They any good?' Mendax asked.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Dunno. I guess so. The solicitor works at Legal Aid, an in-house guy.) Tj
T* (   I've only met them a few times.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `John McLoughlin and Boris Kayser. They did Electron's case.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Trax and Prime Suspect decided to plead guilty. Once they saw the) Tj
T* (   overwhelming evidence--data taps, telephone voice taps, data seized) Tj
T* (   during the raids, nearly a dozen statements by witnesses from the) Tj
T* (   organisations they had hacked, the 300-page Telecom report--they) Tj
T* (   figured they would be better off pleading. The legal brief ran to more) Tj
T* (   than 7000 pages. At least they would get some kudos with the judge for) Tj
T* (   cooperating in the police interviews and pleading early in the) Tj
T* (   process, thus saving the court time and money.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax, however, wanted to fight the charges. He knew about Pad and) Tj
T* (   Gandalf's case and the message from that seemed to be pretty clear:) Tj
T* (   Plead and you go to prison, fight and you might get off free.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The DPP shuffled the charges around so much between mid-1994 and 1995) Tj
T* (   that all the original charges against Trax, issued on 20 July 1994,) Tj
T* (   were dropped in favour of six new charges filed on Valentines Day,) Tj
T* (   1995. At that time, new charges--largely for hacking a Telecom) Tj
T* (   computer--were also laid against Mendax and Prime Suspect.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   By May 1995, the three hackers faced 63 charges in all: 31 for Mendax,) Tj
T* (   26 for Prime Suspect and six for Trax. In addition, NorTel claimed the) Tj
T* (   damages attributed to the hacker incident totalled about $160000--and) Tj
T* (   the company was seeking compensation from the responsible parties. The) Tj
T* (   Australian National University claimed another $4200 in damages.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Most of the charges related to obtaining illegal access to commercial) Tj
T* (   or other information, and inserting and deleting data in numerous) Tj
T* (   computers. The deleting of data was not malicious--it generally) Tj
T* (   related to cleaning up evidence of the hackers' activities. However,) Tj
T* (   all three hackers were also charged with some form of `incitement'. By) Tj
T* (   writing articles for the IS magazine, the prosecution claimed the) Tj
T* (   hackers had been involved in disseminating information which would) Tj
T* (   encourage others to hack and phreak.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   On 4 May 1995 Mendax sat in the office of his solicitor, Paul) Tj
T* (   Galbally, discussing the committal hearing scheduled for the next day.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Galbally was a young, well-respected member of Melbourne's most) Tj
T* (   prestigious law family. His family tree read like a Who's Who of the) Tj
T* (   law. Frank Galbally, his father, was one of Australia's most famous) Tj
T* (   criminal barristers. His uncle, Jack Galbally, was a well-known) Tj
T* (   lawyer, a minister in the State Labor government of John Cain Sr and,) Tj
T* (   later, the Leader of the Opposition in the Victorian parliament. His) Tj
T* (   maternal grandfather, Sir Norman O'Bryan, was a Supreme Court judge,) Tj
T* (   as was his maternal uncle of the same name. The Galballys weren't so) Tj
T* (   much a family of lawyers as a legal dynasty.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Rather than rest on his family's laurels, Paul Galbally worked out of) Tj

T* (   take an hour or so. Although Mendax was contesting the committal) Tj
T* (   hearing along with Prime Suspect on the following day, it was Prime) Tj
T* (   Suspect's barrister, Boris Kayser, who was going to be running the) Tj
T* (   show. Prime Suspect told Mendax he had managed to get full Legal Aid) Tj
T* (   for the committal, something Galbally and Mendax had not been able to) Tj
T* (   procure. Thus Mendax would not have his own barrister at the) Tj
T* (   proceedings.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax didn't mind. Both hackers knew they would be committed to) Tj
T* (   trial. Their immediate objective was to discredit the prosecution's) Tj
T* (   damage claims--particularly NorTel's.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As Mendax and Galbally talked, the mood in the office was upbeat.) Tj
T* (   Mendax was feeling optimistic. Then the phone rang. It was Geoff) Tj
T* (   Chettle, the barrister representing the DPP. While Chettle talked,) Tj
T* (   Mendax watched a dark cloud pass across his solicitor's face. When he) Tj

T* (   really turned. Not until he saw a signed statement. That night he told) Tj
T* (   a friend, `Well, we'll see. Maybe Chettle is just playing it up.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Chettle, however, was not just playing it up.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   There it was--a witness statement--in front of him. Signed by Prime) Tj
T* (   Suspect.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax stood outside the courtroom at Melbourne Magistrates Court trying) Tj
T* (   to reconcile two realities. In the first, there was one of Mendax's four) Tj
T* (   or five closest friends. A friend with whom he had shared his deepest) Tj
T* (   hacking secrets.  A friend he had been hanging out with only last week.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In the other reality, a six-page statement signed by Prime Suspect and) Tj
T* (   Ken Day at AFP Headquarters at 1.20 p.m. the day before. To compound) Tj
T* (   matters, Mendax began wondering if Prime Suspect may have been) Tj
T* (   speaking to the AFP for as long as six months.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The two realities were spinning through his head, dancing around each) Tj
T* (   other.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Galbally arrived at the court, Mendax took him to one side to go) Tj
T* (   over the statement. From a damage-control perspective, it wasn't a) Tj
T* (   complete disaster. Prime Suspect certainly hadn't gone in hard. He) Tj
T* (   could have raised a number of matters, but didn't. Mendax had already) Tj
T* (   admitted to most of the acts which formed the basis of his 31 charges) Tj
T* (   in his police interview. And he had already told the police a good) Tj
T* (   deal about his adventures in Telecom's telephone exchanges.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   However, Prime Suspect had elaborated on the Telecom break-ins in his) Tj
T* (   statement. Telecom was owned by the government, meaning the court) Tj
T* (   would view phreaking from their exchanges not as defrauding a company) Tj
T* (   but as defrauding the Commonwealth. Had the DPP decided to lay those) Tj
T* (   new charges--the Telecom charges--in February 1995 because Prime) Tj
T* (   Suspect had given the AFP a draft Crown witness statement back then?) Tj
T* (   Mendax began to suspect so. Nothing seemed beyond doubt any more.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The immediate crisis was the committal hearing in the Melbourne) Tj
T* (   Magistrates Court. There was no way Boris Kayser was now going to) Tj
T* (   decimate their star witness, a NorTel information systems) Tj
T* (   manager. Galbally would have to run a cross-examination himself--no easy) Tj
T* (   task at short notice, given the highly complex technical aspects of the) Tj
T* (   case.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Inside the courtroom, as Mendax got settled, he saw Prime Suspect. He) Tj
T* (   gave his former friend a hard, unblinking, intense stare. Prime) Tj
T* (   Suspect responded with a blank wall, then he looked away. In fact,) Tj
T* (   even if Mendax had wanted to say something, he couldn't. As a Crown) Tj
T* (   witness, Prime Suspect was off-limits until the case was over.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The lawyers began to file into the courtroom. The DPP representative,) Tj
T* (   Andrea Pavleka, breezed in, momentarily lifting the tension in the) Tj
T* (   windowless courtroom.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   She had that effect on people. Tall, slender and long-legged, with a) Tj
T* (   bob of sandy blonde curls, booky spectacles resting on a cute button) Tj
T* (   nose and an infectious laugh, Pavleka didn't so much walk into a) Tj
T* (   courtroom as waft into it. She radiated happiness from her sunny face.) Tj
T* (   It's a great shame, Mendax thought, that she is on the other side.) Tj

T* (   The court was called into session. Prime Suspect stood in the dock and) Tj
T* (   pleaded guilty to 26 counts of computer crimes.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In the course of the proceedings his barrister, Boris Kayser, told the) Tj
T* (   court that his client had cooperated with the police, including) Tj
T* (   telling the AFP that the hackers had penetrated Telecom's exchanges.) Tj
T* (   He also said that Telecom didn't believe--or didn't want to) Tj
T* (   believe--that their exchanges had been compromised. When Kayser) Tj
T* (   professed loudly what a model citizen his client had been, Ken Day,) Tj
T* (   sitting in the public benches, quietly rolled his eyes.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The magistrate, John Tobin, extended Prime Suspect's bail. The hacker) Tj
T* (   would be sentenced at a later date.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   That matter dealt with, the focus of the courtroom shifted to Mendax's) Tj
T* (   case. Geoff Chettle, for the prosecution, stood up, put the NorTel) Tj
T* (   manager, who had flown in from Sydney, on the stand and asked him some) Tj
T* (   warm-up questions.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Chettle could put people at ease--or rattle them--at will. Topped by a) Tj
T* (   minute stubble of hair, his weathered 40-something face provided a) Tj
T* (   good match to his deep, gravelly voice. With quick eyes and a hard,) Tj
T* (   no-nonsense manner, he lacked the pretentiousness of many barristers.) Tj
T* (   Perhaps because he didn't seem to give a fig about nineteenth century) Tj
T* (   protocols, he always managed to looked out of place in a barrister's) Tj
T* (   wig and robe. Every time he stood up, the black cape slid off his lean) Tj
T* (   shoulders. The barrister's wig went crooked. He continually adjusted) Tj
T* (   it--tugging the wig back into the correct spot like some wayward) Tj
T* (   child. In court, Chettle looked as if he wanted to tear off the crusty) Tj
T* (   trappings of his profession and roll up his sleeves before sinking) Tj
T* (   into a hearty debate. And he looked as if he would rather do it at a) Tj
T* (   pub or the footy.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The NorTel manager took the stand. Chettle asked him some questions) Tj
T* (   designed to show the court the witness was credible, in support of the) Tj
T* (   company's $160000 hacker-clean-up claim. His task accomplished,) Tj
T* (   Chettle sat down.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A little nervous, Paul Galbally stood up to his full height--more than) Tj
T* (   six feet--and straightened his jacket. Dressed in a moss green suit so) Tj
T* (   dark it was almost black, with thin lapels and a thin, 1960s style) Tj
T* (   tie, he looked about as understated hip as a lawyer could--and still) Tj
T* (   show his face in court.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Halting at first, Galbally appeared unsure of himself. Perhaps he had) Tj
T* (   lost his nerve because of the technical issues. WMTP files. UTMP) Tj
T* (   files. PACCT audits. Network architecture. IP addresses. He had been) Tj
T* (   expected to become an expert in the basics literally overnight. A) Tj
T* (   worried Mendax began passing him notes--questions to ask,) Tj
T* (   explanations, definitions. Slowly, Galbally started working up a) Tj
T* (   rhythm to the cross-examination.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   During the questioning someone from the back of the court sidled up to) Tj
T* (   Mendax, in the front row of seats, and handed a note over his) Tj
T* (   shoulder. Mendax unfolded the note, read it and then turned around to) Tj
T* (   smile at the messenger. It was Electron.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   By the time Galbally had finished, he had pulled apart much of the) Tj
T* (   NorTel manager's evidence. As he built up a head of steam quizzing the) Tj
T* (   witness, he forced the NorTel manager to admit he didn't know all that) Tj

T* (   much about the alleged hacking incidents. In fact, he wasn't even) Tj
T* (   employed by the company when they occurred. He had largely thrown) Tj
T* (   together an affidavit based on second-hand information--and it was) Tj
T* (   this affidavit which supposedly proved the hackers had cost the) Tj
T* (   company $160000. Worse, it seemed to an observer at court that the) Tj
T* (   NorTel manager had little Unix security technical expertise and) Tj
T* (   probably would not have been able to conduct a detailed technical) Tj
T* (   analysis of the incident even if he had been with the company in 1991.) Tj
T* (   By the end of the defence's cross-examination, it appeared that) Tj
T* (   Galbally knew more about Unix than the NorTel manager.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Geoff Chettle stood up to re-examine the witness, the situation) Tj
T* (   was hopeless. The manager soon stood down. In Mendax's view, the) Tj
T* (   credibility of the NorTel Manager's statement was shot.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The court was then adjourned until 12 May.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After court, Mendax heard Geoff Chettle talking about the NorTel) Tj
T* (   witness. `That guy is OFF the team,' he said emphatically.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was a mixed victory for Mendax. His solicitor had knocked off one) Tj
T* (   NorTel witness, but there were more where he came from. At a full) Tj
T* (   trial, the prosecution would likely fly in some real NorTel) Tj
T* (   fire-power, from Canada, where the 676-page security incident report) Tj
T* (   had been prepared by Clark Ferguson and other members of the NorTel) Tj
T* (   security team. Those witnesses would understand how a Unix system) Tj
T* (   operated, and would have first-hand knowledge of the hackers') Tj
T* (   intrusions. It could make things much more difficult.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Mendax returned to court a week later, he was committed to stand) Tj
T* (   trial in the County Court of Victoria, as expected.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Later, Mendax asked Galbally about his options. Take the case to full) Tj
T* (   trial, or plead guilty like the other two IS hackers. He wanted to) Tj
T* (   know where the DPP stood on his case. Would they go in hard if he) Tj
T* (   pleaded guilty? Had the NorTel manager disaster at the committal) Tj
T* (   hearing forced them to back down a little?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Paul sighed and shook his head. The DPP were standing firm. They) Tj
T* (   wanted to see Mendax go to prison.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Andrea Pavleka, the DPP's sunny-faced girl who radiated happiness, was) Tj
T* (   baying for blood.) Tj

T* (   One month later, on 21 July 1995, Prime Suspect arrived at the County) Tj
T* (   Court for sentencing.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Rising early that morning to make sure his court suit was in order,) Tj
T* (   Prime Suspect had been tense. His mother cooked him a big breakfast.) Tj
T* (   Toast, bacon and eggs the way he liked it. In fact, his favourite) Tj
T* (   breakfast was an Egg McMuffin from McDonald's, but he never told his) Tj
T* (   mother that.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The courtroom was already crowded. Reporters from newspapers, the wire) Tj

T* (   Dressed in a dark pin-stripe suit, Ken Day stood tapping on a laptop) Tj
T* (   on the prosecution's side of the courtroom. Geoff Chettle sat near) Tj
T* (   him. Prime Suspect's barrister, Boris Kayser, sifted through some) Tj
T* (   papers on the other side.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax lingered at the back of the room, watching his former friend.) Tj
T* (   He wanted to hear Prime Suspect's sentence because, under the rules of) Tj
T* (   parity sentencing, Mendax's own sentence would have to be similar to) Tj
T* (   that of his fellow hackers. However, Prime Suspect might get some) Tj
T* (   dispensation for having helped the prosecution.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A handful of Prime Suspect's friends--none of them from the computer) Tj

T* (   them.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Court was called into session and everyone settled into their seats.) Tj
T* (   The first case, it turned out, was not Prime Suspect's. A tall,) Tj
T* (   silver-haired man in his mid-fifties, with eyes so blue they were) Tj
T* (   almost demonic, stepped into the dock. As the reporters began taking) Tj
T* (   notes, Prime Suspect tried to imagine what crime the polished,) Tj
T* (   well-dressed man had committed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Child molesting.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The man had not just molested children, he had molested) Tj
T* (   his own son. In the parents' bedroom. Repeatedly. On Easter Sunday.) Tj
T* (   His son was less than ten years old at the time. The whole family had) Tj
T* (   collapsed. Psychologically scarred, his son had been too traumatised) Tj
T* (   even to give a victim impact statement.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   For all of this, Judge Russell Lewis told the court, the man had shown) Tj
T* (   no remorse. Grave-faced, the judge sentenced him to a minimum prison) Tj
T* (   term of five years and nine months.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The court clerk then called Prime Suspect's case.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   At the back of the courtroom, Mendax wondered at the strange) Tj
T* (   situation. How could the criminal justice system put a child molester) Tj
T* (   in the same category as a hacker? Yet, here they both were being) Tj
T* (   sentenced side by side in the same County Court room.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Boris Kayser had called a collection of witnesses, all of whom) Tj
T* (   attested to Prime Suspect's difficult life. One of these, the) Tj
T* (   well-regarded psychologist Tim Watson-Munro, described Prime Suspect's) Tj
T* (   treatments at the Austin Hospital and raised the issue of reduced) Tj
T* (   free-will. He had written a report for the court.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Judge Lewis was quick to respond to the suggestion that hacking was an) Tj
T* (   addiction. At one point, he wondered aloud to the courtroom whether) Tj
T* (   some of Prime Suspect's hacking activities were `like a shot of) Tj
T* (   heroin'.) Tj

T* (   Before long, Kayser had launched into his usual style of courtroom) Tj

T* (   his client.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `This fellow should have been dealt with six to twelve months after) Tj
T* (   being apprehended. It is a bit like the US, where a man can commit a) Tj

T* (   twenty years old.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Thoroughly warmed up, Kayser observed that 20 per cent of Prime) Tj
T* (   Suspect's life had gone by since being raided. Then he began hitting) Tj
T* (   his high notes.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `This young man received no assistance in the maturation process. He) Tj
T* (   didn't grow up, he drifted up.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `His world was so horrible that he withdrew into a fantasy world. He) Tj

T* (   `If he hadn't withdrawn into the cybernetic highway, what would he) Tj
T* (   have done instead? Set fires? Robbed houses? Look at the name he gave) Tj

T* (   Not only did Kayser want the judge to dismiss the idea of prison or) Tj
T* (   community service, he was asking him to order no recorded conviction.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The prosecution lawyers looked at Kayser as if he was telling a good) Tj
T* (   joke. The AFP had spent months tracking these hackers and almost three) Tj
T* (   years preparing the case against them. And now this barrister was) Tj
T* (   seriously suggesting that one of the key players should get off) Tj
T* (   virtually scot-free, with not so much as a conviction recorded against) Tj
T* (   him? It was too much.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The judge retired to consider the sentence. When he returned, he was) Tj
T* (   brief and to the point. No prison. No community service. The recording) Tj
T* (   of 26 convictions. A $500 three-year good behaviour bond. Forfeiture) Tj
T* (   of the now ancient Apple computer seized by police in the raid. And a) Tj
T* (   reparation payment to the Australian National University of $2100.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Relief passed over Prime Suspect's face, pink and sweaty from the) Tj
T* (   tension. His friends and family smiled at each other.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Chettle then asked the judge to rule on what he called `the) Tj
T* (   cooperation point'. He wanted the judge to say that Prime Suspect's) Tj
T* (   sentence was less than it would have been because the hacker had) Tj
T* (   turned Crown witness. The DPP was shoring up its position with regard) Tj
T* (   to its remaining target--Mendax.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Judge Lewis told the court that the cooperation in this case made no) Tj
T* (   difference. At the back of the court, Mendax felt suddenly sad. It was) Tj
T* (   good news for him, but somehow it felt like a hollow victory.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Prime Suspect has destroyed our friendship, he thought, and all for) Tj
T* (   nothing.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Two months after Prime Suspect's sentencing, Trax appeared in another) Tj
T* (   County Court room to receive his sentence after pleading guilty to six) Tj
T* (   counts of hacking and phreaking. Despite taking medication to keep his) Tj
T* (   anxiety under control while in the city, he was still very nervous in) Tj
T* (   the dock.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Since he faced the least number of charges of any of the IS hackers,) Tj

T* (   half-whispered rasp--a fact which so annoyed the judge that he sternly) Tj
T* (   instructed the lawyer to speak up.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Talking informally before court, Geoff Chettle had told Mendax that in) Tj
T* (   his view there was no way Judge Mervyn Kimm would let Trax off with no) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A good example of this applied to the aggravated versions of the) Tj
T* (   offence of hacking: viewing commercial information. If, for example,) Tj
T* (   Mendax logged into a NorTel computer, which contained commercially) Tj
T* (   sensitive information, but he didn't actually read any of those files,) Tj
T* (   would he be guilty of `obtaining access' or `obtaining access to) Tj
T* (   commercial information'?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The chief judge of the County Court agreed to the case stated and sent) Tj
T* (   it up to the full bench of the Supreme Court. The lawyers from both) Tj
T* (   sides were pleased with the bench--Justices Frank Vincent, Kenneth) Tj
T* (   Hayne and John Coldrey.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   On 30 September 1996, Mendax arrived at the Supreme Court and found) Tj
T* (   all the lawyers assembled at the court--all except for his barrister.) Tj
T* (   Paul Galbally kept checking his watch as the prosecution lawyers began) Tj
T* (   unpacking their mountains of paper--the fruit of months of) Tj
T* (   preparation. Galbally paced the plush carpet of the Supreme Court) Tj
T* (   anteroom. Still no barrister.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax's barrister had worked tirelessly, preparing for the case) Tj
T* (   stated as if it was a million dollar case. Combing through legal) Tj
T* (   precedents from not only Australia, the UK and the US, but from all) Tj
T* (   the world's Western-style democracies, he had attained a great) Tj
T* (   understanding of the law in the area of computer crime. He had finally) Tj
T* (   arrived at that nexus of understanding between law, philosophy and) Tj
T* (   linguistics which many lesser lawyers spent their entire careers) Tj
T* (   trying to reach.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But where was he? Galbally pulled out his mobile and checked in with) Tj
T* (   his office for what seemed like the fifth time in as many minutes. The) Tj
T* (   news he received was bad. He was told, through second-hand sources,) Tj
T* (   that the barrister had collapsed in a state of nervous exhaustion. He) Tj
T* (   wouldn't be making it to court.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Galbally could feel his hairs turning grey.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When court opened, Galbally had to stand up and explain to three of) Tj
T* (   the most senior judges in Australia why the defence would like a) Tj
T* (   two-day adjournment. A consummate professional, Geoff Chettle) Tj
T* (   supported the submission. Still, it was a difficult request. Time in) Tj
T* (   the Supreme Court is a scarce and valuable thing. Fortunately, the) Tj
T* (   adjournment was granted.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   This gave Galbally exactly two days in which to find a barrister who) Tj
T* (   was good, available and smart enough to assimilate a massive amount of) Tj
T* (   technical information in a short time. He found Andrew Tinney.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Tinney worked around the clock and by Wednesday, 2 October, he was) Tj
T* (   ready. Once again, all the lawyers, and the hacker, gathered at the) Tj
T* (   court.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   This time, however, it was the judges who threw a spanner into the) Tj
T* (   works. They asked both sides to spend the first hour or so explaining) Tj
T* (   exactly why the Supreme Court should hear the case stated at all. The) Tj
T* (   lawyers looked at each other in surprise. What was this all about?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   detailed judgment saying, in essence, that the judges refused to hear) Tj
T* (   the case.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As the judge spoke, it became clear that the Supreme Court judges) Tj
T* (   weren't just refusing to hear this case stated; they were virtually) Tj
T* (   refusing to hear any case stated in future. Not for computer crimes.) Tj
T* (   Not for murder. Not for fraud. Not for anything. They were sending a) Tj
T* (   message to the County Court judges: don't send us a case stated except) Tj
T* (   in exceptional circumstances.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Geoff Chettle slumped in his chair, his hands shielding his face. Paul) Tj
T* (   Galbally looked stunned. Andrew Tinney looked as if he wanted to leap) Tj

T* (   unflappable and inscrutable DPP solicitor who had replaced Andrea) Tj
T* (   Pavleka on the case, looked amazed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The ruling had enormous implications. Judges from the lower courts) Tj
T* (   would be loath to ever send cases to the Supreme Court for) Tj
T* (   clarification on points of law again. Mendax had made legal history,) Tj
T* (   but not in the way he had hoped.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Mendax's case passed back down to the County Court.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He had considered taking his case to trial, but with recently) Tj
T* (   announced budget cuts to Legal Aid, he knew there was little hope of) Tj
T* (   receiving funding to fight the charges. The cuts were forcing the poor) Tj
T* (   to plead guilty, leaving justice available only for the wealthy.) Tj
T* (   Worse, he felt the weight of pleading guilty, not only as a sense of) Tj
T* (   injustice in his own case, but for future hacking cases which would) Tj
T* (   follow. Without clarity on the meaning of the law--which the judges) Tj
T* (   had refused to provide--or a message from a jury in a landmark case,) Tj
T* (   such as Wandii's trial, Mendax believed that hackers could expect) Tj
T* (   little justice from either the police or the courts in the future.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   On 5 December 1996, Mendax pleaded guilty to the remaining six charges) Tj
T* (   and was sentenced on all counts.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Court Two was quiet that day. Geoff Chettle, for the prosecution,) Tj
T* (   wasn't there. Instead, the quietly self-possessed Lesley Taylor) Tj
T* (   handled the matter. Paul Galbally appeared for Mendax himself. Ken Day) Tj
T* (   sat, expressionless, in the front row of the public benches. He looked) Tj
T* (   a little weary. A few rows back, Mendax's mother seemed nervous.) Tj

T* (   announced he would deal with the case. `Two judges have had a crack at) Tj
T* (   it, why not a third one? He might do it properly.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Galbally was concerned. As the morning progressed, he became) Tj
T* (   increasingly distressed; things were not going well. Judge Ross made) Tj
T* (   clear that he personally favoured a custodial sentence, albeit a) Tj
T* (   suspended one. The only thing protecting Mendax seemed to be the) Tj
T* (   principle of parity in sentencing. Prime Suspect and Trax had) Tj
T* (   committed similar crimes to Mendax, and therefore he had to be given a) Tj
T* (   similar sentence.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Ross `registered some surprise' at Judge Lewis's disposition toward) Tj
T* (   the sentencing of Prime Suspect. In the context of parity, he told) Tj
T* (   Leslie Taylor, he was at times `quite soured by some penalties') Tj
T* (   imposed by other judges. He quizzed her for reasons why he might be) Tj
T* (   able to step outside parity.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He told the court that he had not read the telephone intercepts in the) Tj
T* (   legal brief. In fact, he had `only read the summary of facts' and when) Tj
T* (   Taylor mentioned `International Subversive', he asked her, `What was) Tj
T* (   that?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then he asked her how to spell the word `phreak'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Later that day, after Judge Ross had read the other judges' sentences,) Tj
T* (   he gave Mendax a sentence similar to Prime Suspect's--a recorded) Tj
T* (   conviction on all counts, a reparation payment of $2100 to ANU and a) Tj
T* (   three-year good behaviour bond.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   There were two variations. Prime Suspect and Trax both received $500) Tj
T* (   good behaviour bonds; Judge Ross ordered a $5000 bond for Mendax.) Tj
T* (   Further, Judge Lewis had given Prime Suspect almost twelve months to) Tj
T* (   pay his $2100 reparation. Judge Ross ordered Mendax to pay within) Tj
T* (   three months.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Judge Ross told Mendax, `I repeat what I said before. I thought) Tj
T* (   initially that these were offences which justified a jail sentence, but) Tj
T* (   the mitigatory circumstances would have converted that to a suspended) Tj
T* (   sentence. The sentence given to your co-offender caused me to alter that) Tj
T* (   view, however.' He was concerned, he said, `that highly intelligent) Tj
T* (   individuals ought not to behave like this and I suspect it is only) Tj

T* (   to the police, the informant couldn't know the full extent of his) Tj

T* (   part, by his isolation. Anthrax lived in a town in rural Victoria.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Despite the fact that he never joined a hacking partnership like The) Tj
T* (   Realm, Anthrax liked people, liked to talk to them for hours at a time) Tj
T* (   on the telephone. Sometimes he received up to ten international calls) Tj

T* (   The desire for power grew throughout Anthrax's teenage years. He ached) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Anthrax first read about phreaking he wrote to one of his American) Tj
T* (   cracking contacts asking for advice on how to start. His friend sent him) Tj
T* (   a list of AT&T calling card numbers and a toll-free direct-dial number) Tj
T* (   which connected Australians with American operators. The card numbers) Tj
T* (   were all expired or cancelled, but Anthrax didn't care. What captured) Tj
T* (   his imagination was the fact that he could call an operator all the way) Tj
T* (   across the Pacific for free. Anthrax began trying to find more special) Tj
T* (   numbers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He would hang out at a pay phone near his house. It was a seedy) Tj
T* (   neighbourhood, home to the most downtrodden of all the town's) Tj
T* (   residents, but Anthrax would stand at the pay phone for hours most) Tj
T* (   evenings, oblivious to the clatter around him, hand-scanning for) Tj
T* (   toll-free numbers. He dialled 0014--the prefix for the international) Tj
T* (   toll-free numbers--followed by a random set of numbers. Then, as he) Tj
T* (   got more serious, he approached the task more methodically. He) Tj
T* (   selected a range of numbers, such as 300 to 400, for the last three) Tj
T* (   digits. Then he dialled over and over, increasing the number by one) Tj
T* (   each time he dialled. 301. 302. 303. 304. Whenever he hit a) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The scanning became an obsession. Often Anthrax stayed at the phone) Tj
T* (   until 10 or 11 p.m. Some nights it was 3 a.m. The pay phone had a) Tj
T* (   rotary dial, making the task laborious, and sometimes he would come) Tj
T* (   home with blisters on the tips of his fingers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A month or so after he started working, he had saved enough money for) Tj
T* (   a modem.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Hand scanning was boring, but no more so than school. Anthrax attended) Tj
T* (   his state school regularly, at least until year 10. Much of that was) Tj
T* (   due to his mother's influence. She believed in education and in) Tj
T* (   bettering oneself, and she wanted to give her son the opportunities) Tj
T* (   she had been denied. It was his mother, a psychiatric nurse, who) Tj
T* (   scrimped and saved for months to buy him his first real computer, a) Tj
T* (   $400 Commodore 64. And it was his mother who took out a loan to buy) Tj
T* (   the more powerful Amiga a few years later in 1989. She knew the boy) Tj
T* (   was very bright. He used to read her medical textbooks, and computers) Tj
T* (   were the future.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax had always done well in school, earning distinctions every) Tj
T* (   year from year 7 to year 10. But not in maths. Maths bored him. Still,) Tj
T* (   he had some aptitude for it. He won an award in year 6 for designing a) Tj

T* (   attend school so much after year 10. The teachers kept telling him) Tj
T* (   things he already knew, or things he could learn much faster from) Tj

T* (   Anthrax's father, a white Englishman, came from a farming family. One) Tj

T* (   married the sister of an Indian student on a scholarship. Their) Tj
T* (   marriage caused quite a stir, even making the local paper under the) Tj
T* (   headline `Farmer Marries Indian Woman'. It was not a happy marriage) Tj
T* (   and Anthrax often wondered why his father had married an Indian.) Tj
T* (   Perhaps it was a way of rebelling against his dominating father.) Tj
T* (   Perhaps he had once been in love. Or perhaps he simply wanted someone) Tj
T* (   he could dominate and control. Whatever the reason, the decision was) Tj

T* (   tried to avoid the physical abuse but the scrawny teenager was little) Tj
T* (   match for the beefy prison officer. Anthrax and his brother were quiet) Tj
T* (   boys. It seemed to be the path of least resistance with a rough father) Tj
T* (   in a rough town. Besides, it was hard to talk back in the painful) Tj
T* (   stutter both boys shared through their early teens.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   One day, when Anthrax was fifteen, he came home to find a commotion at) Tj
T* (   his house. On entering the house, Anthrax went to his parents') Tj
T* (   bedroom. He found his mother there, and she was very upset and) Tj
T* (   emotionally distressed. He couldn't see his father anywhere, but found) Tj
T* (   him relaxing on the sofa in the lounge room, watching TV.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Disgust consumed Anthrax and he retreated into the kitchen. When his) Tj
T* (   father came in not long after to prepare some food Anthrax watched his) Tj
T* (   back with revulsion. Then he noticed a carving knife resting on the) Tj
T* (   counter. As Anthrax reached for the knife, an ambulance worker) Tj
T* (   appeared in the doorway. Anthrax put the knife down and walked away.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But he wasn't so quiet after that. He started talking back, at home and) Tj
T* (   at school, and that marked the beginning of the really big problems. In) Tj
T* (   primary school and early high school he had been beaten up now and) Tj
T* (   again. Not any more. When a fellow student hauled Anthrax up against the) Tj

T* (   wall of the locker shed and started shaking him and waving his fist,) Tj
T* (   Anthrax lost it. He saw, for a moment, his father's face instead of the) Tj
T* (   student's and began to throw punches in a frenzy that left his victim in) Tj
T* (   a terrible state.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   At home, Anthrax's father learned how to bait his son. The bully) Tj
T* (   always savours a morsel of resistance from the victim, which makes) Tj
T* (   going in for the kill a little more fun. Talking back gave the father) Tj
T* (   a good excuse to get violent. Once he nearly broke his son's neck.) Tj
T* (   Another time it was his arm. He grabbed Anthrax and twisted his arm) Tj
T* (   behind his back. There was an eerie sound of cracking cartilage, and) Tj
T* (   then pain. Anthrax screamed for his father to stop. His father twisted) Tj
T* (   Anthrax's arm harder, then pressed on his neck. His mother shrieked at) Tj
T* (   her husband to let go of her son. He wouldn't.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Look at you crying,' his father sneered. `You disgusting animal.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `You're the disgusting animal,' Anthrax shouted, talking back again.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   His father threw Anthrax on the floor and began kicking him in the) Tj
T* (   head, in the ribs, all over.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax ran away. He went south to Melbourne for a week, sleeping) Tj
T* (   anywhere he could, in the empty night-time spaces left over by day) Tj
T* (   workers gone to orderly homes. He even crashed in hospital emergency) Tj
T* (   rooms. If a nurse asked why he was there, he would answer politely, `I) Tj
T* (   received a phone call to meet someone here'. She would nod her head) Tj
T* (   and move on to someone else.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Eventually, when Anthrax returned home, he took up martial arts to) Tj
T* (   become strong. And he waited.) Tj

T* (   Anthrax was poking around a MILNET gateway when he stumbled on the) Tj
T* (   door to System X.* He had wanted to find this system for months,) Tj
T* (   because he had intercepted email about it which had aroused his) Tj
T* (   curiosity.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax telnetted into the gateway. A gateway binds two different) Tj
T* (   networks. It allows, for example, two computer networks which talk) Tj
T* (   different languages to communicate. A gateway might allow someone on a) Tj
T* (   system running DECNET to login to a TCP/IP based system, like a Unix.) Tj
T* (   Anthrax was frustrated that he couldn't seem to get past the System X) Tj
T* (   gateway and on to the hosts on the other side.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Using normal address formats for a variety of networks, he tried) Tj
T* (   telling the gateway to make a connection. X.25. TCP/IP. Whatever lay) Tj
T* (   beyond the gateway didn't respond. Anthrax looked around until he) Tj
T* (   found a sample of addresses in a help file. None of them worked, but) Tj
T* (   they offered a clue as to what format an address might take.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Each address had six digits, the first three numbers of which) Tj
T* (   corresponded to telephone area codes in the Washington DC area. So he) Tj
T* (   picked one of the codes and started guessing the last three digits.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Hand scanning was a pain, as ever, but if he was methodical and) Tj
T* (   persistent, something should turn up. 111. 112. 113. 114. 115. On it) Tj
T* (   went. Eventually he connected to something--a Sunos Unix system--which) Tj
T* (   gave him a full IP address in its login message. Now that was handy.) Tj

T* (   With the full IP address, he could connect to System X again through) Tj
T* (   the Internet directly--avoiding the gateway if he chose to. It's) Tj
T* (   always helpful in covering your tracks to have a few different routing) Tj
T* (   options. Importantly, he could approach System X through more than) Tj
T* (   just its front door.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax spiralled through the usual round of default usernames and) Tj
T* (   passwords. Nothing. This system required a more strategic attack.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He backed out of the login screen, escaped from the gateway and went) Tj
T* (   to another Internet site to have a good look at System X from a) Tj
T* (   healthy distance. He `fingered' the site, pulling up any bit of) Tj
T* (   information System X would release to the rest of the Internet when) Tj
T* (   asked. He probed and prodded, looking for openings. And then he found) Tj
T* (   one. Sendmail.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The version of Sendmail run by System X had a security hole Anthrax) Tj
T* (   could exploit by sending himself a tiny backdoor program. To do this,) Tj
T* (   he used System X's mail-processing service to send a `letter' which) Tj
T* (   contained a tiny computer program. System X would never have allowed) Tj
T* (   the program to run normally, but this program worked like a letter) Tj
T* (   bomb. When System X opened the letter, the program jumped out and) Tj
T* (   started running. It told System X that anyone could connect to port) Tj
T* (   2001--to an interactive shell--of the computer without using a) Tj
T* (   password.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A port is a door to the outside world. TCP/IP computers use a standard) Tj
T* (   set of ports for certain services. Port 25 for mail. Port 79 for) Tj
T* (   Finger. Port 21 for FTP. Port 23 for Telnet. Port 513 for Rlogin. Port) Tj
T* (   80 for the World Wide Web. A TCP/IP based computer system has 65535) Tj
T* (   ports but most of them go unused. Indeed, the average Unix box uses) Tj
T* (   only 35, leaving the remaining 65500 ports sitting idle. Anthrax) Tj
T* (   simply picked one of these sleepy ports, dusted off the cobwebs and) Tj
T* (   plugged in using the backdoor created by his tiny mail-borne program.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Connecting directly to a port created some problems, because the) Tj
T* (   system wouldn't recognise certain keystrokes from the port, such as) Tj
T* (   the return key. For this reason, Anthrax had to create an account for) Tj
T* (   himself which would let him telnet to the site and login like any) Tj
T* (   normal user. To do this, he needed root privileges in order to create) Tj
T* (   an account and, ultimately, a permanent backdoor into the system.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He began hunting for vulnerabilities in System X's security. There was) Tj
T* (   nothing obvious, but he decided to try out a bug he had successfully) Tj
T* (   used elsewhere. He had first learned about it on an international) Tj
T* (   phone conference, where he had traded information with other hackers) Tj
T* (   and phreakers. The security hole involved the system's relatively) Tj
T* (   obscure load-module program. The program added features to the running) Tj
T* (   system but, more importantly, it ran as root, meaning that it had a) Tj
T* (   free run on the system when it was executed. It also meant that any) Tj
T* (   other programs the load-module program called up also ran as root. If) Tj
T* (   Anthrax could get this program to run one of his own programs--a) Tj
T* (   little Trojan--he could get root on System X.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The load-module bug was by no means a sure thing on System X. Most) Tj
T* (   commercial systems--computers run by banks or credit agencies, for) Tj
T* (   example--had cleaned up the load-module bug in their Sunos computers) Tj
T* (   months before. But military systems consistently missed the bug. They) Tj
T* (   were like turtles--hard on the outside, but soft and vulnerable on the) Tj
T* (   inside. Since the bug couldn't be exploited unless a hacker was) Tj

T* (   already inside a system, the military's computer security officials) Tj
T* (   didn't seem to pay much attention to it. Anthrax had visited a large) Tj
T* (   number of military systems prior to System X, and in his experience) Tj
T* (   more than 90 per cent of their Sunos computers had never fixed the) Tj
T* (   bug.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   With only normal privileges, Anthrax couldn't force the load-module) Tj
T* (   program to run his backdoor Trojan program. But he could trick it into) Tj
T* (   doing so. The secret was in one simple keyboard character: /.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Unix-based computer systems are a bit like the protocols of the) Tj
T* (   diplomatic corps; the smallest variation can change something's) Tj
T* (   meaning entirely. Hackers, too, understand the implications of subtle) Tj
T* (   changes.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A Unix-based system reads the phrase:) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   /bin/program) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   very differently from:) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   bin program) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   One simple character--the `/'--makes an enormous difference. A Unix) Tj
T* (   computer reads the `/' as a road sign. The first phrase tells the) Tj
T* (   computer, `Follow the road to the house of the user called "bin" and) Tj
T* (   when you get there, go inside and fetch the file called "program" and) Tj
T* (   run it'. A blank space, however, tells the computer something quite) Tj
T* (   different. In this case, Anthrax knew it told the computer to execute) Tj
T* (   the command which proceeded the space. That second phrase told the) Tj
T* (   machine, `Look everywhere for a program called "bin" and run it'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax prepared for his attack on the load-module program by) Tj
T* (   installing his own special program, named `bin', into a temporary) Tj
T* (   storage area on System X. If he could get System X to run his program) Tj
T* (   with root privileges, he too would have procured root level access to) Tj
T* (   the system. When everything was in place, Anthrax forced the system to) Tj
T* (   read the character `/' as a blank space. Then he ran the load-module) Tj
T* (   program, and watched. When System X hunted around for a program named) Tj
T* (   `bin', it quickly found Anthrax's Trojan and ran it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The hacker savoured the moment, but he didn't pause for long. With a) Tj
T* (   few swift keystrokes, he added an entry to the password file, creating) Tj
T* (   a basic account for himself. He exited his connection to port 2001,) Tj
T* (   circled around through another route, using the 0014 gateway, and) Tj
T* (   logged into System X using his newly created account. It felt good) Tj
T* (   walking in through the front door.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Once inside, Anthrax had a quick look around. The system startled him.) Tj
T* (   There were only three human users. Now that was definitely odd. Most) Tj
T* (   systems had hundreds of users. Even a small system might serve 30 or) Tj
T* (   40 people, and this was not a small system. He concluded that System X) Tj
T* (   wasn't just some machine designed to send and receive email. It was) Tj
T* (   operational. It did something.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax considered how to clean up his footsteps and secure his) Tj
T* (   position. While he was hardly broadcasting his presence, someone might) Tj
T* (   discover his arrival simply by looking at who was logged in on the) Tj
T* (   list of accounts in the password file. He had given his backdoor root) Tj
T* (   account a bland name, but he could reasonably assume that these three) Tj

T* (   probably the kind of system that had lots of babysitting. After all) Tj
T* (   that effort, Anthrax needed a watchful nanny like a hole in the head.) Tj
T* (   He worked at moving into the shadows.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He removed himself from the WTMP and UTMP files, which listed who had) Tj
T* (   been on-line and who was still logged in. Anthrax wasn't invisible,) Tj
T* (   but an admin would have to look closely at the system's network) Tj
T* (   connections and list of processes to find him. Next stop: the login) Tj
T* (   program.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax couldn't use his newly created front-door account for an) Tj
T* (   extended period--the risk of discovery was too great. If he accessed) Tj
T* (   the computer repeatedly in this manner, a prying admin might) Tj
T* (   eventually find him and delete his account. An extra account on a) Tj
T* (   system with only three users was a dead give-away. And losing access) Tj
T* (   to System X just as things were getting interesting was not on his) Tj
T* (   agenda.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax leaned back in his chair and stretched his shoulders. His) Tj
T* (   hacking room was an old cloakroom, though it was barely recognisable) Tj
T* (   as such. It looked more like a closet--a very messy closet. The whole) Tj
T* (   room was ankle-deep in scrap papers, most of them with lists of) Tj
T* (   numbers on the back and front. Occasionally, Anthrax scooped up all) Tj
T* (   the papers and piled them into heavy-duty garbage bags, three of which) Tj
T* (   could just fit inside the room at any one time. Anthrax always knew) Tj
T* (   roughly where he had `filed' a particular set of notes. When he needed) Tj
T* (   it, he tipped the bag onto the floor, searched through the mound and) Tj
T* (   returned to the computer. When the sea of paper reached a critical) Tj
T* (   mass, he jammed everything back into the garbage bag again.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The computer--an Amiga 500 box with a cheap Panasonic TV as the) Tj
T* (   monitor--sat on a small desk next to his mother's sewing machine) Tj
T* (   cabinet. The small bookcase under the desk) Tj
T* (   was stuffed with magazines like Compute and Australian Communications,) Tj
T* (   along with a few Commodore, Amiga and Unix reference manuals. There) Tj
T* (   was just enough space for Anthrax's old stereo and his short-wave) Tj
T* (   radio. When he wasn't listening to his favourite show, a hacking) Tj
T* (   program broadcast from a pirate station in Ecuador, he tuned into) Tj
T* (   Radio Moscow or the BBC's World Service.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax considered what to do with System X. This system had aroused) Tj
T* (   his curiosity and he intended to visit it frequently.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was time to work on the login patch. The patch replaced the) Tj
T* (   system's normal login program and had a special feature: a master) Tj
T* (   password. The password was like a diplomatic passport. It would let) Tj
T* (   him do anything, go anywhere. He could login as any user using the) Tj
T* (   master password. Further, when he logged in with the master password,) Tj
T* (   he wouldn't show up on any log files--leaving no trail. But the beauty) Tj
T* (   of the login patch was that, in every other way, it ran as the normal) Tj
T* (   login program. The regular computer users--all three of them--could) Tj
T* (   login as usual with their passwords and would never know Anthrax had) Tj
T* (   been in the system.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He thought about ways of setting up his login patch. Installing a) Tj
T* (   patch on System X wasn't like mending a pair of jeans. He couldn't) Tj
T* (   just slap on a swath from an old bandanna and quick-stitch it in with) Tj
T* (   a thread of any colour. It was more like mending an expensive cashmere) Tj

T* (   And because the patch required high-quality invisible mending, the) Tj
T* (   size also needed to be just right.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Every file in a computer system has three dates: the date it was) Tj
T* (   created, the date it was last modified and the date it was last) Tj
T* (   accessed. The problem was that the login patch needed to have the same) Tj
T* (   creation and modification dates as the original login program so that) Tj
T* (   it would not raise suspicions. It wasn't hard to get the dates but it) Tj
T* (   was difficult to paste them onto the patch. The last access date) Tj
T* (   wasn't important as it changed whenever the program was run) Tj
T* (   anyway--whenever a user of the System X logged in.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   If Anthrax ripped out the original login program and stitched his) Tj
T* (   patch in its place, the patch would be stamped with a new creation) Tj
T* (   date. He knew there was no way to change a creation date short of) Tj
T* (   changing the clock for the whole system--something which would cause) Tj
T* (   problems elsewhere in System X.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The first thing a good system admin does when he or she suspects a) Tj
T* (   break-in is search for all files created or modified over the previous) Tj
T* (   few days. One whiff of an intruder and a good admin would be all over) Tj
T* (   Anthrax's login patch within about five minutes.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax wrote the modification and creation dates down on a bit of) Tj
T* (   paper. He would need those in a moment. He also jotted down the size) Tj
T* (   of the login file.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Instead of tearing out the old program and sewing in a completely new) Tj
T* (   one, Anthrax decided to overlay his patch by copying it onto the top) Tj
T* (   of the old program. He uploaded his own login patch, with his master) Tj
T* (   password encased inside it, but he didn't install it yet. His patch) Tj
T* (   was called `troj'--short for Trojan. He typed:) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   cat<troj>/bin/login) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The cat command told the computer: `go get the data in the file called) Tj
T* (   "troj" and put it in the file "/bin/login"'. He checked the piece of) Tj
T* (   paper where he had scribbled down the original file's creation and) Tj
T* (   modification dates, comparing them to the new patch. The creation date) Tj
T* (   and size matched the original. The modification date was still wrong,) Tj
T* (   but he was two-thirds of the way home.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax began to fasten down the final corner of the patch by using a) Tj
T* (   little-known feature of the command:) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   /usr/5bin/date) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then he changed the modification date of his login patch to the) Tj
T* (   original login file's date.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He stepped back to admire his work from a distance. The newly) Tj
T* (   installed patch matched the original perfectly. Same size. Same) Tj
T* (   creation date. Same modification date. With patch in place, he deleted) Tj
T* (   the root account he had installed while visiting port 2001. Always) Tj
T* (   take your garbage with you when you leave.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Now for the fun bit. Snooping around. Anthrax headed off for the) Tj
T* (   email, the best way to work out what a system was used for. There were) Tj
T* (   lots of reports from underlings to the three system users on buying) Tj
T* (   equipment, progress reports on a certain project, updates. What was) Tj

T* (   this project?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then Anthrax came across a huge directory. He opened it and there,) Tj
T* (   couched inside, were perhaps 100 subdirectories. He opened one of) Tj
T* (   them. It was immense, containing hundreds of files. The smallest) Tj
T* (   subfile had perhaps 60 computer screens' worth of material, all of it) Tj
T* (   unintelligible. Numbers, letters, control codes. Anthrax couldn't make) Tj
T* (   head nor tail of the files. It was as if he was staring at a group of) Tj
T* (   binary files. The whole subdirectory was filled with thousands of) Tj
T* (   pages of mush. He thought they looked like data files for some) Tj
T* (   database.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As he didn't have the program he needed to interpret the mush, Anthrax) Tj
T* (   cast around looking for a more readable directory.) Tj

T* (   He pried open a file and discovered it was a list. Names and phone) Tj
T* (   numbers of staff at a large telecommunications company. Work phone) Tj
T* (   numbers. Home numbers. Well, at least that gave him a clue as to the) Tj
T* (   nature of the project. Something to do with telecommunications. A) Tj

T* (   continued to disrupt it with his violence. Fun times with his friends) Tj
T* (   shone like bright spots amidst the decay of Anthrax's family life.) Tj
T* (   Practical jokes were his specialty. Even as a small child, he had) Tj
T* (   delighted in trickery and as he grew up, the jokes became more) Tj

T* (   the world. And pranking was cool.) Tj

T* (   Most of the fun in pranking was sharing it with friends. Anthrax) Tj
T* (   called into a voice conference frequented by phreakers and hackers.) Tj
T* (   Though he never trusted others completely when it came to working on) Tj
T* (   projects together, it was OK to socialise. The phreaking methods he) Tj

T* (   he was discreet in how much he said in the conference, he thought) Tj

T* (   `What is your code, sir?' The operator asked.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yes, well, this is Mr Baker. I have a sheet with a lot of numbers) Tj
T* (   here. I am new to the company. Not sure which one it is.' Anthrax) Tj
T* (   shuffled papers on top of the pay phone, near the receiver. `How many) Tj
T* (   digits is it?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Seven.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   That was helpful. Now to find seven digits. Anthrax looked across the) Tj
T* (   street at the fish and chips shop. No numbers there. Then a car) Tj
T* (   licence plate caught his eye. He read off the first three digits, then) Tj
T* (   plucked the last four numbers from another car's plate.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Thank you. Putting your call through, Mr Baker.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A valid number! What amazing luck. Anthrax milked that number for all) Tj
T* (   it was worth. Called party lines. Called phreakers' bridges. Access) Tj
T* (   fed the obsession.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then he gave the number to a friend in Adelaide, to call overseas. But) Tj
T* (   when that friend read off the code, the operator jumped in.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `YOU'RE NOT MR BAKER!') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Huh? `Yes I am. You have my code.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `You are definitely not him. I know his voice.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The friend called Anthrax, who laughed his head off, then called into) Tj
T* (   Dialcom and changed his code! It was a funny incident. Still, it) Tj
T* (   reminded him how much safer it was working by himself.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Living in the country was hard for a hacker and Anthrax became a) Tj
T* (   phreaker out of necessity, not just desire. Almost everything involved) Tj
T* (   a long-distance call and he was always searching for ways to make) Tj
T* (   calls for free. He noticed that when he called certain 008) Tj
T* (   numbers--free calls--the phone would ring a few times, click, and then) Tj
T* (   pause briefly before ringing some more. Eventually a company) Tj
T* (   representative or answering service picked up the call. Anthrax had) Tj
T* (   read about diverters, devices used to forward calls automatically, in) Tj
T* (   one of the many telecommunications magazines and manuals he was) Tj
T* (   constantly reading. The click suggested the call was going through a) Tj
T* (   diverter and he guessed that if he punched in the right tones at the) Tj
T* (   right moment, he could make the call divert away from a company's) Tj
T* (   customer service agent. Furthermore, any line trace would end up at) Tj
T* (   the company.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Antrax collected some 008 numbers and fiddled with them. He discovered) Tj
T* (   that if he punched another number in very quickly over the top of the) Tj
T* (   ringing--just after the click--he could make the line divert to where) Tj
T* (   he wanted it to go. He used the 008 numbers to ring phone conferences) Tj
T* (   around the world, where he hung out with other phreakers, particularly) Tj
T* (   Canadians such as members of the Toronto-based UPI or the Montreal) Tj
T* (   group, NPC, which produced a phreakers' manual in French. The) Tj
T* (   conversation on the phreaker's phone conferences, or phone bridges as) Tj
T* (   they are often called, inevitably turned to planning a prank. And) Tj
T* (   those Canadian guys knew how to prank!) Tj

T* (   Once, they rang the emergency phone number in a major Canadian city.) Tj
T* (   Using the Canadian incarnation of his social engineering accents,) Tj
T* (   Anthrax called in a `police officer in need of assistance'. The) Tj
T* (   operator wanted to know where. The phreakers had decided on the Blue) Tj
T* (   Ribbon Ice-Cream Parlour. They always picked a spot within visual) Tj
T* (   range of at least one member, so they could see what was happening.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In the split second of silence which followed, one of the five other) Tj
T* (   phreakers quietly eavesdropping on the call coughed. It was a short,) Tj
T* (   sharp cough. The operator darted back on the line.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Was that A GUN SHOT? Are you SHOT? Hello? John?' The operator leaned) Tj
T* (   away from her receiver for a moment and the phreakers heard her) Tj
T* (   talking to someone else in the background. `Officer down.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Things moved so fast when pranking. What to do now?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Ah, yeah. Yeah.' It was amazing how much someone squeezing laughter) Tj
T* (   back down his oesophagus can sound like someone who has been shot.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `John, talk to me. Talk to me,' the operator pleaded into the phone,) Tj
T* (   trying to keep John alert.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I'm down. I'm down,' Anthrax strung her along.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax disconnected the operator from the conference call. Then the) Tj
T* (   phreaker who lived near the ice-cream parlour announced the street had) Tj
T* (   been blocked off by police cars. They had the parlour surrounded and) Tj
T* (   were anxiously searching for an injured fellow officer. It took) Tj
T* (   several hours before the police realised someone had played a mean) Tj
T* (   trick on them.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   However, Anthrax's favourite prank was Mr McKenny, the befuddled) Tj
T* (   southern American hick. Anthrax had selected the phone number at) Tj
T* (   random, but the first prank was such fun he kept coming back for more.) Tj
T* (   He had been ringing Mr McKenny for years. It was always the same) Tj
T* (   conversation.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Mr McKenny? This is Peter Baker. I'd like my shovel back, please.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I don't have your shovel.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yeah, I lent it to you. Lent it to you like two years ago. I want it) Tj
T* (   back now.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I never borrowed no shovel from you. Go away.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `You did. You borrowed that shovel of mine. And if you don't give it) Tj
T* (   back I'm a gonna come round and get it myself. And you won't like it.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yes, sir, I see you advertised that you wanted to buy a bathtub.') Tj
T* (   Anthrax put on his serious voice. `I have a bathtub for sale.') Tj

T* (   This, of course, made sense, since a computer picked them out in the) Tj

T* (   related to. This made sense too. The list wasn't meant to be read by) Tj
T* (   humans.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Occasionally, there were comments in the list. Programmers often) Tj
T* (   include a line of comment in code, which is delineated in such a way) Tj

T* (   The comments are for other programmers examining the code. In this) Tj

T* (   Hackers and phreakers usually have areas of expertise. In Australian) Tj
T* (   terms, Anthrax was a master of the X.25 network and a king of voice) Tj
T* (   mailbox systems, and others in the underground recognised him as such.) Tj
T* (   He knew Trilogues better than most company technicians. He knew) Tj
T* (   Meridian VMB systems better than almost anyone in Australia. In the) Tj
T* (   phreaking community, he was also a world-class expert in Aspen VMB) Tj
T* (   systems. He did not, however, have any expertise in DMS 100s.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax quickly hunted through his hacking disks for a text file on) Tj
T* (   DMS 100s he had copied from an underground BBS. The pressure was on.) Tj
T* (   He didn't want to spend long inside the exchange, maybe only fifteen) Tj
T* (   or twenty minutes tops. The longer he stayed without much of a clue) Tj
T* (   about how the thing operated, the greater the risk of his being) Tj
T* (   traced. When he found the disk with the text file, he began sorting) Tj
T* (   through it while still on-line at the telephone exchange. The) Tj
T* (   phreakers' file showed him some basic commands, things which let him) Tj
T* (   gently prod the exchange for basic information without disturbing the) Tj
T* (   system too much. He didn't want to do much more for fear of) Tj
T* (   inadvertently mutilating the system.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Although he was not an authority on DMS 100s, Anthrax had an old) Tj
T* (   hacker friend overseas who was a real genius on NorTel equipment. He) Tj
T* (   gave the list to his friend. Yes, the friend confirmed it was indeed a) Tj
T* (   DMS 100 exchange at a US military base. It was not part of the normal) Tj
T* (   telephone system, though. This exchange was part of a military phone) Tj

T* (   have separate networks for their data communications. These networks) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Soon, however, Anthrax began eroding his father's authority. He) Tj
T* (   discovered his father's secrets hidden on the Commodore 64 computer.) Tj
T* (   Letters--lots of them--to his family in England. Vicious, racist,) Tj
T* (   horrid letters telling how his wife was stupid. How she had to be told) Tj
T* (   how to do everything, like a typical Indian. How he regretted marrying) Tj
T* (   her. There were other matters too, things unpleasant to discuss.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax confronted his father, who denied the allegations at first,) Tj
T* (   then finally told Anthrax to keep his mouth shut and mind his own) Tj
T* (   business. But Anthrax told his mother. Tensions erupted and, for a) Tj
T* (   time, Anthrax's parents saw a marriage counsellor.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But his father did not give up writing the letters. He put a password) Tj
T* (   protection program on the word processor to keep his son out of his) Tj
T* (   business. It was a futile effort. His father had chosen the wrong) Tj
T* (   medium to record his indiscretions.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax showed his mother the new letters and continued to confront) Tj
T* (   his father. When the tension in the house grew, Anthrax would escape) Tj
T* (   with his friends. One night they were at a nightclub when someone) Tj
T* (   started taunting Anthrax, calling him `curry muncher' and worse.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   That was it. The anger which had been simmering below the surface for) Tj
T* (   so long exploded as Anthrax violently attacked his taunter, hitting,) Tj

T* (   been learning. There was blood and it felt good. Vengeance tasted) Tj
T* (   sweet.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After that incident, Anthrax often lashed out violently. He was out of) Tj
T* (   control and it sometimes scared him. However, at times he went looking) Tj
T* (   for trouble. Once he tracked down a particularly seedy character who) Tj
T* (   had tried to rape one of his girlfriends. Anthrax pulled a knife on) Tj
T* (   the guy, but the incident had little to do with the girl. The thing) Tj
T* (   that made him angry was the disrespect. This guy knew the girl was) Tj
T* (   with Anthrax. The attempted rape was like spitting in his face.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Perhaps that's what appealed to Anthrax about Islam--the importance of) Tj
T* (   respect. At sixteen he found Islam and it changed his life. He) Tj
T* (   discovered the Qu'raan in the school library while researching an) Tj
T* (   assignment on religion. About the same time, he began listening to a) Tj
T* (   lot of rap music. More than half the American rappers in his music) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax and his new school proved a bad match. The school thought he) Tj
T* (   asked too many questions, and Anthrax thought the school answered too) Tj
T* (   few of them. The hypocrisy of the Catholic church riled Anthrax and) Tj
T* (   pushed him further into the arms of NOI. How could he respect an) Tj

T* (   progressive method of converting people? The school and Anthrax parted) Tj
T* (   on less than friendly terms after just one semester.) Tj

T* (   The Catholic school intensified a feeling of inferiority Anthrax had) Tj

T* (   told him that he wasn't inferior at all. `I know that you have been) Tj

T* (   marriages don't work. A white man marries a non-white woman because he) Tj
T* (   wants a slave, not because he loves and respects her. Islam respects) Tj
T* (   women in more meaningful ways than Western religions. Perhaps it wasn't) Tj
T* (   the type of respect that Western men were used to giving women, but he) Tj

T* (   in your own household. Today is the great time of separation of the) Tj
T* (   righteous Muslim and the wicked white race.' Anthrax looked inside his) Tj
T* (   own household and saw what seemed to be a devil. A white devil.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   NOI fed Anthrax's mind. He followed up the lists of literature) Tj

T* (   The binaries seemed to need a monitor which could display graphics.) Tj
T* (   They used XII, a graphical display common on Unix systems. Anthrax's) Tj
T* (   inexpensive home computer didn't have that sort of graphical display) Tj
T* (   operating system. He could still run the binaries by telling System X) Tj
T* (   to run them on one of its local terminals, but he wouldn't be able to) Tj
T* (   see the output on his home computer. More importantly, it was a risky) Tj
T* (   course of action. What if someone happened to be sitting at the) Tj
T* (   terminal where he chose to run the binary? The game would be up.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He leaned away from his keyboard and stretched. Exhaustion was) Tj
T* (   beginning to set in. He hadn't slept in almost 48 hours. Occasionally,) Tj
T* (   he had left his computer terminal to eat, though he always brought the) Tj
T* (   food back to the screen. His mother popped her head in the doorway) Tj
T* (   once in a while and shook her head silently. When he noticed her) Tj
T* (   there, he tried to ease her concerns. `But I'm learning lots of) Tj
T* (   things,' he pleaded. She was not convinced.) Tj

T* (   devout Muslim to practice salat--to pray at least five times a day) Tj

T* (   followers to group some of their prayers, so Anthrax usually grouped) Tj
T* (   two in the morning, prayed once at midday as normal, and grouped two) Tj
T* (   more at night. An efficient way to meet religious obligations.) Tj

T* (   Sometimes the time just slipped away, hacking all night. When the) Tj
T* (   first hint of dawn snuck up on him, he was invariably in the middle of) Tj
T* (   some exciting journey. But duty was duty, and it had to be done. So he) Tj
T* (   pressed control S to freeze his screen, unfurled the prayer mat with) Tj
T* (   its built-in compass, faced Mecca, knelt down and did two sets of) Tj
T* (   prayers before sunrise. Ten minutes later he rolled the prayer mat up,) Tj
T* (   slid back into his chair, typed control Q to release the pause on his) Tj

T* (   It made sense. The maintenance time spent by humans would be cut) Tj
T* (   dramatically.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A machine which gathers statistics and services phone exchanges) Tj
T* (   remotely doesn't sound very sexy on the face of it, until you begin to) Tj
T* (   consider what you could do with something like that. You could sell it) Tj
T* (   to a foreign power interested in the level of activity at a certain) Tj
T* (   base at a particular time. And that is just the beginning.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   You could tap any unencrypted line going in or out of any of the 100) Tj

T* (   that country might pay a pretty penny for getting intelligence on the) Tj

T* (   All of those options paled next to the most striking power wielded by) Tj
T* (   a hacker who had unlimited access to System X and the 100 or so) Tj
T* (   telephone exchanges. He could take down that US military voice) Tj
T* (   communications system almost overnight, and he could do it) Tj
T* (   automatically. The potential for havoc creation was breathtaking. It) Tj
T* (   would be a small matter for a skilled programmer to alter the) Tj
T* (   automated program used by System X. Instead of using its dozen or more) Tj
T* (   modems to dial all the exchanges overnight and poll them for) Tj
T* (   statistics, System X could be instructed to call them overnight and) Tj
T* (   reprogram the exchanges.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   What if every time General Colin Powell picked up his phone, he was be) Tj
T* (   automatically patched through to some Russian general's office? He) Tj
T* (   wouldn't be able to dial any other number from his office phone. He'd) Tj
T* (   pick up his phone to dial and there would be the Russian at the other) Tj
T* (   end. And what if every time someone called into the general's number,) Tj
T* (   they ended up talking to the stationery department? What if none of the) Tj
T* (   phone numbers connected to their proper telephones?  No-one would be) Tj
T* (   able to reach one another. An important part of the US military machine) Tj
T* (   would be in utter disarray. Now, what if all this happened in the first) Tj
T* (   few days of a war? People trying to contact each other with vital) Tj
T* (   information wouldn't be able to use the telephone exchanges reprogrammed) Tj
T* (   by System X.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   THAT was power.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It wasn't like Anthrax screaming at his father until his voice turned) Tj
T* (   to a whisper, all for nothing. He could make people sit up and take) Tj
T* (   notice with this sort of power.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Hacking a system gave him a sense of control. Getting root on a system) Tj
T* (   always gave him an adrenalin rush for just that reason. It meant the) Tj
T* (   system was his, he could do whatever he wanted, he could run whatever) Tj
T* (   processes or programs he desired, he could remove other users he) Tj
T* (   didn't want using his system. He thought, I own the system. The word) Tj
T* (   `own' anchored the phrase which circled through his thoughts again and) Tj
T* (   again when he successfully hacked a system.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The sense of ownership was almost passionate, rippled with streaks of) Tj
T* (   obsession and jealousy. At any given moment, Anthrax had a list of) Tj

T* (   had barged in, sat down on the couch and started talking to her.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was never enough to look at a system from a distance and know he) Tj
T* (   could hack it if he wanted to. Anthrax had to actually hack the) Tj
T* (   system. He had to own it. He needed to see what was inside the system,) Tj
T* (   to know exactly what it was he owned.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The worst thing admins could do was to fiddle with system security.) Tj
T* (   That made Anthrax burn with anger. If Anthrax was on-line, silently) Tj
T* (   observing the admins' activities, he would feel a sudden urge to log) Tj
T* (   them off. He wanted to punish them. Wanted them to know he was into) Tj
T* (   their system. And yet, at the same time, he didn't want them to know.) Tj
T* (   Logging them off would draw attention to himself, but the two desires) Tj
T* (   pulled at him from opposite directions. What Anthrax really wanted was) Tj
T* (   for the admins to know he controlled their system, but for them not to) Tj
T* (   be able to do anything about it. He wanted them to be helpless.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax decided to keep undercover. But he contemplated the power of) Tj
T* (   having System X's list of telephone exchange dial-ups and their) Tj
T* (   username-password combinations. Normally, it would take days for a) Tj
T* (   single hacker with his lone modem to have much impact on the US) Tj
T* (   military's communications network. Sure, he could take down a few) Tj
T* (   exchanges before the military wised up and started protecting) Tj
T* (   themselves. It was like hacking a military computer. You could take) Tj
T* (   out a machine here, a system there. But the essence of the power of) Tj
T* (   System X was being able to use its own resources to orchestrate) Tj
T* (   widespread pandemonium quickly and quietly.) Tj

T* (   Anthrax defines power as the potential for real world impact. At that) Tj
T* (   moment of discovery and realisation, the real world impact of hacking) Tj
T* (   System X looked good. The telecommunications company computer seemed) Tj
T* (   like a good place to hang up a sniffer, so he plugged one into the) Tj
T* (   machine and decided to return in a little while. Then he logged out) Tj
T* (   and went to bed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When he revisited the sniffer a day or so later, Anthrax received a) Tj
T* (   rude shock. Scrolling through the sniffer file, he did a double take) Tj
T* (   on one of the entries. Someone had logged into the company's system) Tj
T* (   using his special login patch password.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He tried to stay calm. He thought hard. When was the last time he had) Tj
T* (   logged into the system using that special password? Could his sniffer) Tj
T* (   have logged himself on an earlier hacking session? It did happen) Tj
T* (   occasionally. Hackers sometimes gave themselves quite a fright. In the) Tj
T* (   seamless days and nights of hacking dozens of systems, it was easy to) Tj
T* (   forget the last time you logged into a particular system using the) Tj
T* (   special password. The more he thought, the more he was absolutely) Tj
T* (   sure. He hadn't logged into the system again.) Tj

T* (   Different things set him off. The librarian, for example. In early) Tj
T* (   1993 Anthrax had enrolled in Asia-Pacific and Business Studies at a) Tj
T* (   university in a nearby regional city. Ever since he showed up on the) Tj
T* (   campus, he had been hassled by a student who worked part-time at the) Tj
T* (   university library. On more than one occasion, Anthrax had been) Tj
T* (   reading at a library table when a security guard came up and asked to) Tj
T* (   search his bags. And when Anthrax looked over his shoulder to the) Tj
T* (   check-out desk, that librarian was always there, the one with the bad) Tj
T* (   attitude smeared across his face.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The harassment became so noticeable, Anthrax's friends began) Tj
T* (   commenting on it. His bag would be hand-searched when he left the) Tj
T* (   library, while other students walked through the electronic security) Tj
T* (   boom gate unbothered. When he returned a book one day late, the) Tj
T* (   librarian--that librarian--insisted he pay all sorts of fines.) Tj
T* (   Anthrax's pleas of being a poor student fell on deaf ears. By the time) Tj
T* (   exam period rolled around at the end of term, Anthrax decided to) Tj
T* (   punish the librarian by taking down the library's entire computer) Tj
T* (   system.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Logging in to the library computer via modem from home, Anthrax) Tj
T* (   quickly gained root privileges. The system had security holes a mile) Tj
T* (   wide. Then, with one simple command, he deleted every file in the) Tj
T* (   computer. He knew the system would be backed up somewhere, but it) Tj
T* (   would take a day or two to get the system up and running again. In the) Tj
T* (   meantime, every loan or book search had to be conducted manually.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   During Anthrax's first year at university, even small incidents) Tj
T* (   provoked punishment. Cutting him off while he was driving, or swearing) Tj
T* (   at him on the road, fit the bill. Anthrax would memorise the licence) Tj
T* (   plate of the offending driver, then social engineer the driver's) Tj
T* (   personal details. Usually he called the police to report what appeared) Tj
T* (   to be a stolen car and then provided the licence plate number. Shortly) Tj
T* (   after, Anthrax tuned into to his police scanner, where he picked up) Tj
T* (   the driver's name and address as it was read over the airways to the) Tj
T* (   investigating police car. Anthrax wrote it all down.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then began the process of punishment. Posing as the driver, Anthrax rang) Tj
T* (   the driver's electricity company to arrange a power disconnection. The) Tj
T* (   next morning the driver might return home to find his electricity cut) Tj
T* (   off. The day after, his gas might be disconnected.  Then his water. Then) Tj
T* (   his phone.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Some people warranted special punishment--people such as Bill. Anthrax) Tj
T* (   came across Bill on the Swedish Party Line, an English-speaking) Tj
T* (   telephone conference. For a time, Anthrax was a regular fixture on the) Tj
T* (   line, having attempted to call it by phreaking more than 2000 times) Tj
T* (   over just a few months. Of course, not all those attempts were) Tj
T* (   successful, but he managed to get through at least half the time. It) Tj
T* (   required quite an effort to keep a presence on the party line, since) Tj
T* (   it automatically cut people off after only ten minutes. Anthrax made) Tj
T* (   friends with the operators, who sometimes let him stay on-line a while) Tj
T* (   longer.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Bill, a Swedish Party Line junkie, had recently been released from) Tj

T* (   Anthrax felt wretched. His mother was distraught at the destruction) Tj

T* (   running another sniffer that logged Anthrax's previous login. But it) Tj
T* (   was more likely to be a security admin. Meaning he had been found out.) Tj
T* (   Meaning that he might be being traced even as he leap-frogged through) Tj
T* (   System X to the telecommunications company's computer.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax made his way to the system admin's mailboxes. If the game was) Tj
T* (   up, chances were something in the mailbox would give it away.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   There it was. The evidence. They were onto him all right, and they) Tj
T* (   hadn't wasted any time. The admins had mailed CERT, the Computer) Tj
T* (   Emergency Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University, reporting a) Tj
T* (   security breach. CERT, the nemesis of every Internet hacker, was bound) Tj
T* (   to complicate matters. Law enforcement would no doubt be called in) Tj
T* (   now.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was time to get out of this system, but not before leaving in a) Tj
T* (   blaze of glory. A prank left as a small present.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   CERT had written back to the admins acknowledging the incident and) Tj
T* (   providing a case number. Posing as one of the admins, Anthrax drafted) Tj
T* (   a letter to CERT. To make the thing look official, he added the case) Tj
T* (   number `for reference'. The letter went something like this:) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `In regard to incident no. XXXXX, reported on this date, we have since) Tj
T* (   carried out some additional investigations on the matter. We have) Tj
T* (   discovered the security incident was caused by a disgruntled employee) Tj
T* (   who was fired for alcoholism and decided to retaliate against the) Tj
T* (   company in this manner.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `We have long had a problem with alcohol and drug abuse due to the) Tj
T* (   stressful nature of the company environment. No further investigation) Tj
T* (   is necessary.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   At his computer terminal, Anthrax smiled. How embarrassing was that) Tj
T* (   going to be? Try scraping that mud off. He felt very pleased with) Tj
T* (   himself.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax then tidied up his things in the company's computer, deleted) Tj
T* (   the sniffer and moved out.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Things began to move quickly after that. He logged into System X later) Tj
T* (   to check the sniffer records, only to find that someone had used his) Tj
T* (   login patch password on that system as well. He became very nervous.) Tj
T* (   It was one thing goofing around with a commercial site, and quite) Tj
T* (   another being tracked from a military computer.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A new process had been added to System X, which Anthrax recognised. It) Tj
T* (   was called `-u'. He didn't know what it did, but he had seen it before) Tj
T* (   on military systems. About 24 hours after it appeared, he found) Tj
T* (   himself locked out of the system. He had tried killing off the -u) Tj
T* (   process before. It disappeared for a split-second and reappeared. Once) Tj
T* (   it was in place, there was no way to destroy it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax also unearthed some alarming email. The admin at a site) Tj
T* (   upstream from both System X and the company's system had been sent a) Tj
T* (   warning letter: `We think there has been a security incident at your) Tj
T* (   site'. The circle was closing in on him. It was definitely time to get) Tj
T* (   the hell out. He packed up his things in a hurry. Killed off the) Tj
T* (   remaining sniffer. Moved his files. Removed the login patch. And) Tj

T* (   departed with considerable alacrity.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After he cut his connection, Anthrax sat wondering about the admins.) Tj
T* (   If they knew he was into their systems, why did they leave the) Tj
T* (   sniffers up and running? He could understand leaving the login patch.) Tj
T* (   Maybe they wanted to track his movements, determine his motives, or) Tj
T* (   trace his connection. Killing the patch would have simply locked him) Tj
T* (   out of the only door the admins could watch. They wouldn't know if he) Tj
T* (   had other backdoors into their system. But the sniffer? It didn't make) Tj
T* (   any sense.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was possible that they simply hadn't seen the sniffer. Leaving it) Tj
T* (   there had been an oversight. But it was almost too glaring an error to) Tj
T* (   be a real possibility. If it was an error, it implied the admins) Tj
T* (   weren't actually monitoring the connections in and out of their) Tj
T* (   systems. If they had been watching the connections, they would) Tj
T* (   probably have seen the sniffer. But if they weren't monitoring the) Tj
T* (   connections, how on earth did they find out his special password for) Tj
T* (   the login patch? Like all passwords on the system, that one was) Tj
T* (   encrypted. There were only two ways to get that password. Monitor the) Tj
T* (   connection and sniff it, or break the encryption with a brute-force) Tj
T* (   attack.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Breaking the encryption would probably have taken millions of dollars) Tj
T* (   of computer time. He could pretty well rule that option out. That left) Tj
T* (   sniffing it, which would have alerted them to his own sniffer. Surely) Tj
T* (   they wouldn't have left his sniffer running on purpose. They must have) Tj
T* (   known he would learn they were watching him through his sniffer. The) Tj
T* (   whole thing was bizarre.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax thought about the admins who were chasing him. Thought about) Tj
T* (   their moves, their strategies. Wondered why. It was one of the) Tj
T* (   unsolved mysteries a hacker often faced--an unpleasant side of) Tj
T* (   hacking. Missing the answers to certain questions, the satisfaction of) Tj
T* (   a certain curiosity. Never being able to look over the fence at the) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Perhaps he didn't really want to be caught so much as tracked. Anthrax) Tj
T* (   liked the idea of the police tracking him, of the system) Tj
T* (   administrators pursuing him. He liked to follow the trail of their) Tj
T* (   investigations through other people's mail. He especially liked being) Tj
T* (   on-line, watching them trying to figure out where he was coming from.) Tj
T* (   He would cleverly take control of their computers in ways they) Tj
T* (   couldn't see. He watched every character they typed, every spelling) Tj
T* (   error, every mistyped command, each twist and turn taken in the vain) Tj
T* (   hope of catching him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He hadn't been caught back in early 1991, when it seemed everyone was) Tj
T* (   after him. In fact Anthrax nearly gave up hacking and phreaking) Tj
T* (   completely in that year after what he later called `The Fear of God') Tj
T* (   speech.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Late at night, on a university computer system, he bumped into another) Tj
T* (   hacker. It wasn't an entirely uncommon experience. Once in a while,) Tj
T* (   hackers recognised another of their kind. Strange connections to) Tj
T* (   strange places in the middle of the night. Inconsistencies in process) Tj
T* (   names and sizes. The clues were visible for those who knew how to find) Tj
T* (   them.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The two hackers danced around each other, trying to determine who the) Tj
T* (   other was without giving away too much information. Finally the) Tj
T* (   mystery hacker asked Anthrax, `Are you a disease which affects sheep?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax typed the simple answer back. `Yes.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The other hacker revealed himself as Prime Suspect, one of the) Tj
T* (   International Subversives. Anthrax recognised the name. He had seen) Tj
T* (   Prime Suspect around on the BBSes, had read his postings. Before) Tj
T* (   Anthrax could get started on a friendly chat, the IS hacker jumped in) Tj
T* (   with an urgent warning.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He had unearthed emails showing the Feds were closing in on Anthrax.) Tj
T* (   The mail, obtained from system admins at Miden Pacific, described the) Tj
T* (   systems Anthrax had been visiting. It showed the phone connections he) Tj
T* (   had been using to get to them, some of which Telecom had traced back) Tj
T* (   to his phone. One of the admins had written, `We're on to him. I feel) Tj
T* (   really bad. He's seventeen years old and they are going to bust him) Tj
T* (   and ruin his life.' Anthrax felt a cold chill run down his spine.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Prime Suspect continued with the story. When he first came across the) Tj
T* (   email, he thought it referred to himself. The two hackers were the) Tj
T* (   same age and had evidently been breaking into the same systems. Prime) Tj
T* (   Suspect had freaked out over the mail. He took it back to the other) Tj
T* (   two IS hackers, and they talked it through. Most of the description) Tj
T* (   fitted, but a few of the details didn't seem to make sense. Prime) Tj
T* (   Suspect wasn't calling from a country exchange. The more they worked) Tj
T* (   it through, the clearer it became that the email must have been) Tj
T* (   referring to someone else. They ran through the list of other options) Tj
T* (   and Anthrax's name came up as a possibility. The IS hackers had all) Tj
T* (   seen him around a few systems and BBSes. Trax had even spoken to him) Tj
T* (   once on a conference call with another phreaker. They pieced together) Tj
T* (   what they knew of him and the picture fitted. The AFP were onto) Tj
T* (   Anthrax and they seemed to know a lot about him. They had traced his) Tj
T* (   telephone connection back to his house. They knew his age, which) Tj
T* (   implied they knew his name. The phone bills were in his parents') Tj

T* (   Feds were so close they were all but treading on his heels. The IS) Tj
T* (   hackers had been keeping an eye out for him, to warn him, but this was) Tj
T* (   the first time they had found him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax thanked Prime Suspect and got out of the system. He sat frozen) Tj
T* (   in the night stillness. It was one thing to contemplate getting caught,) Tj
T* (   to carry mixed emotions on the hypothetical situation. It was another to) Tj
T* (   have the real prospect staring you in the face. In the morning, he) Tj
T* (   gathered up all his hacking papers, notes, manuals--everything. Three) Tj
T* (   trunks' worth of material. He carried it all to the back garden, lit a) Tj
T* (   bonfire and watched it burn. He vowed to give up hacking forever.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   And he did give it up, for a time. But a few months later he somehow) Tj
T* (   found himself back in front of his computer screen, with his modem) Tj
T* (   purring. It was so tempting, so hard to let go. The police had never) Tj
T* (   shown up. Months had come and gone, still nothing. Prime Suspect must) Tj
T* (   have been wrong. Perhaps the AFP were after another hacker entirely.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then, in October 1991, the AFP busted Prime Suspect, Mendax and Trax.) Tj
T* (   But Anthrax continued to hack, mostly on his own as usual, for another) Tj
T* (   two years. He reminded himself that the IS hackers worked in a team.) Tj
T* (   If the police hadn't nailed him when they busted the others, surely) Tj
T* (   they would never find him now. Further, he had become more skilled as) Tj
T* (   a hacker, better at covering his tracks, less likely to draw attention) Tj
T* (   to himself. He had other rationalisations too. The town where he lived) Tj
T* (   was so far away, the police would never bother travelling all the way) Tj

T* (   The removalists were due to arrive to take things from the half-empty) Tj
T* (   apartment he had shared with another student. His room-mate had) Tj
T* (   already departed and the place was a clutter of boxes stuffed with) Tj
T* (   clothes, tapes and books.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax sat in bed half-asleep, half-watching the `Today' show when he) Tj
T* (   heard the sound of a large vehicle pulling up outside. He looked out) Tj
T* (   the window expecting to see the removalists. What he saw instead was) Tj
T* (   at least four men in casual clothes running toward the house.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   They were a little too enthusiastic for removalists and they split up) Tj
T* (   before getting to the door, with two men forking off toward opposite) Tj
T* (   sides of the building. One headed for the car port. Another dove) Tj
T* (   around the other side of the building. A third banged on the front) Tj
T* (   door. Anthrax shook himself awake.) Tj

T* (   The short, stocky guy at the front door was a worry. He had puffy,) Tj
T* (   longish hair and was wearing a sweatshirt and acid-wash jeans so tight) Tj
T* (   you could count the change in his back pocket. Bad ideas raced through) Tj
T* (   Anthrax's head. It looked like a home invasion. Thugs were going to) Tj
T* (   break into his home, tie him up and terrorise him before stealing all) Tj
T* (   his valuables.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Open up. Open up,' the stocky one shouted, flashing a police badge.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   Anthrax looked confused. No. Not sure.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `The Australian Federal Police.' The cop proceeded to read out the) Tj
T* (   search warrant.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   What happened from this point forward is a matter of some debate. What) Tj
T* (   is fact is that the events of the raid and what) Tj
T* (   followed formed the basis of a formal complaint by Anthrax to the) Tj
T* (   Office of the Ombudsman and an internal investigation within the AFP.) Tj
T* (   The following is simply Anthrax's account of how it happened.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The stocky one barked at Anthrax, `Where's your computer?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `What computer?' Anthrax looked blankly at the officer. He didn't have) Tj
T* (   a computer at his apartment. He used the uni's machines or friend's) Tj
T* (   computers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Your computer. Where is it? Which one of your friends has it?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No-one has it. I don't own one.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Well, when you decide to tell us where it is, you let us know.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Yeah. Right. If Anthrax did have a hidden computer at uni, revealing) Tj
T* (   its location wasn't top of the must-do list.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The police pawed through his personal letters, quizzed Anthrax about) Tj
T* (   them. Who wrote this letter? Is he in the computer underground? What's) Tj
T* (   his address?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax said `no comment' more times than he could count. He saw a few) Tj
T* (   police moving into his bedroom and decided it was time to watch them) Tj
T* (   closely, make sure nothing was planted. He stood up to follow them in) Tj
T* (   and observe the search when one of the cops stopped him. Anthrax told) Tj
T* (   them he wanted a lawyer. One of the police looked on with disapproval.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `You must be guilty,' he told Anthrax. `Only guilty people ask for) Tj
T* (   lawyers. And here I was feeling sorry for you.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Then one of the other officers dropped the bomb. `You know,' he began) Tj
T* (   casually, `we're also raiding your parents' house ...') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax freaked out. His mum would be hysterical. He asked to call his) Tj
T* (   mother on his mobile, the only phone then working in the apartment.) Tj
T* (   The police refused to let him touch his mobile. Then he asked to call) Tj
T* (   her from the pay phone across the street. The police refused again.) Tj
T* (   One of the officers, a tall, lanky cop, recognised a leverage point if) Tj
T* (   ever he saw one. He spread the guilt on thick.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Your poor sick mum. How could you do this to your poor sick mum?) Tj
T* (   We're going to have to take her to Melbourne for questioning, maybe) Tj
T* (   even to charge her, arrest her, take her to jail. You make me sick. I) Tj
T* (   feel sorry for a mother having a son like you who is going to cause) Tj

T* (   From that moment on, the tall officer took every opportunity to talk) Tj
T* (   about Anthrax's `poor sick mum'. He wouldn't let up. Not that he) Tj
T* (   probably knew the first thing about scleroderma, the creeping fatal) Tj

T* (   to comfort him.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Don't worry. It will be all right,' she said it, over and over. No) Tj
T* (   matter what Anthrax said, she repeated that phrase, like a chant. In) Tj
T* (   trying to console him, she was actually calming herself. Anthrax) Tj
T* (   listened to her trying to impose order on the chaos around her. He) Tj
T* (   could hear noises in the background and he guessed it was the police) Tj
T* (   rummaging through her home. Suddenly, she said she had to go and hung) Tj
T* (   up.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax handed the phone back to the police and sat with his head in) Tj
T* (   his hands. What a wretched situation. He couldn't believe this was) Tj
T* (   happening to him. How could the police seriously consider taking his) Tj
T* (   mother to Melbourne for questioning? True, he phreaked from her home) Tj
T* (   office phone, but she had no idea how to hack or phreak. As for) Tj
T* (   charging his mother, that would just about kill her. In her mental and) Tj
T* (   physical condition, she would simply collapse, maybe never to get up) Tj
T* (   again.) Tj

T* (   to Melbourne for a police interview.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `It is your best interest to cooperate,' one of the cops told him. `It) Tj
T* (   would be in your best interest to come with us now.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax pondered that line for a moment, considered how ludicrous it) Tj
T* (   sounded coming from a cop. Such a bald-faced lie told so) Tj
T* (   matter-of-factly. It would have been humorous if the situation with) Tj
T* (   his mother hadn't been so awful. He agreed to an interview with the) Tj
T* (   police, but it would have to be done on another day.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The cops wanted to search his car. Anthrax didn't like it, but there) Tj
T* (   was nothing incriminating in the car anyway. As he walked outside in) Tj
T* (   the winter morning, one of the cops looked down at Anthrax's feet,) Tj
T* (   which were bare in accordance with the Muslim custom of removing shoes) Tj
T* (   in the house. The cop asked if he was cold.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The other cop answered for Anthrax. `No. The fungus keeps them warm.') Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax swallowed his anger. He was used to racism, and plenty of it,) Tj
T* (   especially from cops. But this was over the top.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In the town where he attended uni, everyone thought he was Aboriginal.) Tj
T* (   There were only two races in that country town--white and Aboriginal.) Tj
T* (   Indian, Pakistani, Malay, Burmese, Sri Lankan--it didn't matter. They) Tj
T* (   were all Aboriginal, and were treated accordingly.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Once when he was talking on the pay phone across from his house, the) Tj
T* (   police pulled up and asked him what he was doing there. Talking on the) Tj
T* (   phone, he told them. It was pretty obvious. They asked for) Tj
T* (   identification, made him empty his pockets, which contained his small) Tj
T* (   mobile phone. They told him his mobile must be stolen, took it from) Tj
T* (   him and ran a check on the serial number. Fifteen minutes and many) Tj
T* (   more accusations later, they finally let him go with the flimsiest of) Tj
T* (   apologies. `Well, you understand,' one cop said. `We don't see many of) Tj
T* (   your type around here.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Yeah. Anthrax understood. It looked pretty suspicious, a dark-skinned) Tj
T* (   boy using a public telephone. Very suss indeed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In fact, Anthrax had the last laugh. He had been on a phreaked call to) Tj
T* (   Canada at the time and he hadn't bothered to hang up when the cops) Tj
T* (   arrived. Just told the other phreakers to hang on. After the police) Tj
T* (   left, he picked up the conversation where he left off.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Incidents like that taught him that sometimes the better path was to) Tj
T* (   toy with the cops. Let them play their little games. Pretend to be) Tj
T* (   manipulated by them. Laugh at them silently and give them nothing. So) Tj
T* (   he appeared to ignore the fungus comment and led the cops to his car.) Tj
T* (   They found nothing.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When the police finally packed up to leave, one of them handed Anthrax) Tj
T* (   a business card with the AFP's phone number.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Call us to arrange an interview time,' he said.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Sure,' Anthrax replied as he shut the door.) Tj
T* () Tj
T* (                                    [ ]) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax keep putting the police off. Every time they called hassling) Tj
T* (   him for an interview, he said he was busy. But when they began ringing) Tj
T* (   up his mum, he found himself in a quandary. They were threatening and) Tj
T* (   yet reassuring to his mother all at the same time and spoke politely) Tj
T* (   to her, even apologetically.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `As bad as it sounds,' one of them said, `we're going to have to) Tj
T* (   charge you with things Anthrax has done, hacking, phreaking, etc. if) Tj
T* (   he doesn't cooperate with us. We know it sounds funny, but we're) Tj
T* (   within our rights to do that. In fact that is what the law dictates) Tj
T* (   because the phone is in your name.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He followed this with the well-worn `it's in your son's best interest) Tj
T* (   to cooperate' line, delivered with cooing persuasion.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax wondered why there was no mention of charging his father,) Tj
T* (   whose name appeared on the house's main telephone number. That line) Tj
T* (   also carried some illegal calls.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   His mother worried. She asked her son to cooperate with the police.) Tj
T* (   Anthrax felt he had to protect his mother and finally agreed to a) Tj
T* (   police interview after his uni exams. The only reason he did so was) Tj
T* (   because of the police threat to charge his mother. He was sure that if) Tj
T* (   they dragged his mother through court, her health would deteriorate) Tj
T* (   and lead to an early death.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax's father picked him up from uni on a fine November day and) Tj
T* (   drove down to Melbourne. His mother had insisted that he attend the) Tj
T* (   interview, since he knew all about the law and police. Anthrax didn't) Tj
T* (   mind having him along: he figured a witness might prevent any use of) Tj
T* (   police muscle.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   During the ride to the city, Anthrax talked about how he would handle) Tj
T* (   the interview. The good news was that the AFP had said they wanted to) Tj
T* (   interview him about his phreaking, not his hacking. He went to the) Tj
T* (   interview understanding they would only be discussing his `recent) Tj
T* (   stuff'--the phreaking. He had two possible approaches to the) Tj
T* (   interview. He could come clean and admit everything, as his first) Tj
T* (   lawyer had advised. Or he could pretend to cooperate and be evasive,) Tj
T* (   which was what his instincts told him to do.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   His father jumped all over the second option. `You have to cooperate) Tj
T* (   fully. They will know if you are lying. They are trained to pick out) Tj
T* (   lies. Tell them everything and they will go easier on you.' Law and) Tj
T* (   order all the way.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Who do they think they are anyway? The pigs.' Anthrax looked away,) Tj
T* (   disgusted at the thought of police harassing people like his mother.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Don't call them pigs,' his father snapped. `They are police officers.) Tj
T* (   If you are ever in trouble, they are the first people you are ever) Tj
T* (   going to call.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Oh yeah. What kind of trouble am I going to be in that the first) Tj
T* (   people I call are the AFP?' Anthrax replied.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax would put up with his father coming along so long as he kept) Tj
T* (   his mouth shut during the interview. He certainly wasn't there for) Tj
T* (   personal support. They had a distant relationship at best. When his) Tj
T* (   father began working in the town where Anthrax now lived and studied,) Tj
T* (   his mother had tried to patch things between them. She suggested his) Tj
T* (   father take Anthrax out for dinner once a week, to smooth things over.) Tj
T* (   Develop a relationship. They had dinner a handful of times and Anthrax) Tj
T* (   listened to his father's lectures. Admit you were wrong. Cooperate) Tj
T* (   with the police. Get your life together. Own up to it all. Grow up. Be) Tj
T* (   responsible. Stop being so useless. Stop being so stupid.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The lectures were a bit rich, Anthrax thought, considering that his) Tj
T* (   father had benefited from Anthrax's hacking skills. When he discovered) Tj
T* (   Anthrax had got into a huge news clipping database, he asked the boy) Tj
T* (   to pull up every article containing the word `prison'. Then he had him) Tj
T* (   search for articles on discipline. The searches should have cost a) Tj
T* (   fortune, probably thousands of dollars. But his father didn't pay a) Tj
T* (   cent, thanks to Anthrax. And he didn't spend much time lecturing) Tj
T* (   Anthrax on the evils of hacking then.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When they arrived at AFP headquarters, Anthrax made a point of putting) Tj
T* (   his feet up on the leather couch in the reception area and opened a) Tj

T* (   can of Coke he had brought along. His father got upset.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Get your feet off that seat. You shouldn't have brought that can of) Tj
T* (   Coke. It doesn't look very professional.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Hey, I'm not going for a job interview here,' Anthrax responded.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Constable Andrew Sexton, a redhead sporting two earrings, came up to) Tj
T* (   Anthrax and his father and took them upstairs for coffee. Detective) Tj
T* (   Sergeant Ken Day, head of the Computer Crime Unit, was in a meeting,) Tj
T* (   Sexton said, so the interview would be delayed a little.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax's father and Sexton found they shared some interests in law) Tj
T* (   enforcement. They discussed the problems associated with) Tj
T* (   rehabilitation and prisoner discipline. Joked with each other.) Tj
T* (   Laughed. Talked about `young Anthrax'. Young Anthrax did this. Young) Tj
T* (   Anthrax did that.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Young Anthrax felt sick. Watching his own father cosying up to the) Tj
T* (   enemy, talking as if he wasn't even there.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Sexton went to check on whether Day had finished his meeting,) Tj
T* (   Anthrax's father growled, `Wipe that look of contempt off your face,) Tj
T* (   young man. You are going to get nowhere in this world if you show that) Tj
T* (   kind of attitude, they are going to come down on you like a ton of) Tj
T* (   bricks.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax didn't know what to say. Why should he treat these people with) Tj
T* (   any respect after the way they threatened his mother?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The interview room was small but very full. A dozen or more boxes, all) Tj
T* (   filled with labelled print-outs.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Sexton began the interview. `Taped record of interview conducted at) Tj
T* (   Australian Federal Police Headquarters, 383 Latrobe Street Melbourne) Tj
T* (   on 29 November 1994.' He reeled off the names of the people present) Tj
T* (   and asked each to introduce himself for voice recognition.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `As I have already stated, Detective Sergeant Day and I are making) Tj
T* (   enquiries into your alleged involvement into the manipulation of) Tj
T* (   private automated branch exchanges [PABXes] via Telecom 008 numbers in) Tj
T* (   order to obtain free phone calls nationally and internationally. Do) Tj
T* (   you clearly understand this allegation?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yes.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Sexton continued with the necessary, and important, preliminaries. Did) Tj
T* (   Anthrax understand that he was not obliged to answer any questions?) Tj
T* (   That he had the right to communicate with a lawyer? That he had) Tj
T* (   attended the interview of his own free will? That he was free to leave) Tj
T* (   at any time?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Yes, Anthrax said in answer to each question.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Sexton then ploughed through a few more standard procedures before he) Tj
T* (   finally got to the meat of the issue--telephones. He fished around in) Tj
T* (   one of the many boxes and pulled out a mobile phone. Anthrax confirmed) Tj
T* (   that it was his phone.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   subsequent connections?' Sexton asked.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yes.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Contained in that phone is a number of pre-set numbers. Do you) Tj
T* (   agree?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yes.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I went to the trouble of extracting those records from it.' Sexton) Tj
T* (   looked pleased with himself for hacking Anthrax's speed-dial numbers) Tj
T* (   from the mobile. `Number 22 is of some interest to myself. It comes up) Tj
T* (   as Aaron. Could that be the person you referred to before as Aaron in) Tj
T* (   South Australia?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yes, but he is always moving house. He is a hard person to track) Tj
T* (   down.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Sexton went through a few more numbers, most of which Anthrax hedged.) Tj
T* (   He asked Anthrax questions about his manipulation of the phone system,) Tj
T* (   particularly about the way he made free calls overseas using) Tj
T* (   Australian companies' 008 numbers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When Anthrax had patiently explained how it all worked, Sexton went) Tj
T* (   through some more speed-dial numbers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Number 43. Do you recognise that one?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `That's the Swedish Party Line.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `What about these other numbers? Such as 78? And 30?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I'm not sure. I couldn't say what any of these are. It's been so) Tj
T* (   long,' Anthrax paused, sensing the pressure from the other side of the) Tj
T* (   table. `These ones here, they are numbers in my town. But I don't know) Tj
T* (   who. Very often, 'cause I don't have any pen and paper with me, I just) Tj
T* (   plug a number into the phone.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Sexton looked unhappy. He decided to go in a little harder. `I'm going) Tj
T* (   to be pretty blunt. So far you have admitted to the 008s but I think) Tj
T* (   you are understating your knowledge and your experience when it comes) Tj
T* (   to these sort of offences.' He caught himself. `Not offences. But your) Tj
T* (   involvement in all of this ... I think you have got a little bit more) Tj
T* (   ... I'm not saying you are lying, don't get me wrong, but you tend to) Tj
T* (   be pulling yourself away from how far you were really into this. And) Tj
T* (   how far everyone looked up to you.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   There was the gauntlet, thrown down on the table. Anthrax picked it) Tj
T* (   up.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `They looked up to me? That was just a perception. To be honest, I) Tj
T* (   don't know that much. I couldn't tell you anything about telephone) Tj
T* (   exchanges or anything like that. In the past, I guess the reason they) Tj
T* (   might look up to me in the sense of a leader is because I was doing) Tj
T* (   this, as you are probably aware, quite a bit in the past, and) Tj
T* (   subsequently built up a reputation. Since then I decided I wouldn't do) Tj

T* (   `No. Before. I just said, "I don't want anything to do with this any) Tj
T* (   more. It's just stupid". When I broke up with my girlfriend ... I just) Tj
T* (   got dragged into it again. I'm not trying to say that I am any less) Tj
T* (   responsible for any of this but I will say I didn't originate any of) Tj
T* (   these 008s. They were all scanned by other people. But I made calls) Tj
T* (   and admittedly I did a lot of stupid things.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I just felt that you were tending to ... I don't know if it's because) Tj
T* (   your dad's here or ... I have read stuff that "Anthrax was a legend) Tj

T* (   to about X.25, Tymnet, hacking, Unix. The whole kit and kaboodle".') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax didn't take the bait. Cops always try that line. Play on a) Tj
T* (   hacker's ego, get them to brag. It was so transparent.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `It's not true,' he answered. `I know nothing about ... I can't) Tj
T* (   program. I have an Amiga with one meg of memory. I have no formal) Tj
T* (   background in computers whatsoever.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   That part was definitely true. Everything was self-taught. Well,) Tj
T* (   almost everything. He did take one programming class at uni, but he) Tj
T* (   failed it. He went to the library to do extra research, used in his) Tj
T* (   final project for the course. Most of his classmates wrote simple) Tj
T* (   200-line programs with few functions; his ran to 500 lines and had) Tj
T* (   lots of special functions. But the lecturer flunked him. She told him,) Tj
T* (   `The functions in your program were not taught in this course'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Sexton asked Anthrax if he was into carding, which he denied) Tj
T* (   emphatically. Then Sexton headed back into scanning. How much had) Tj
T* (   Anthrax done? Had he given scanned numbers to other hackers? Anthrax) Tj
T* (   was evasive, and both cops were getting impatient.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `What I am trying to get at is that I believe that, through your) Tj
T* (   scanning, you are helping other people break the law by promoting this) Tj
T* (   sort of thing.' Sexton had shown his hand.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No more than a telephone directory would be assisting someone,) Tj
T* (   because it's really just a list. I didn't actually break anything. I) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No. Just have a look around. I'm not very good at breaking VMBs.') Tj

T* (   that document there is a 1-900 number. What are they generally for?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Easy question. `In America they like cost $10 a minute. You can ring) Tj

T* (   telephone systems, be it voice mailboxes ... I'm not saying you found) Tj
T* (   the 008s but you ... anything to bugger up Telecom. You were really) Tj
T* (   getting into it and you were helping other people.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax took offence. `The motivation for me doing it wasn't to bugger) Tj
T* (   up Telecom.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Sexton backpedalled. `Perhaps ... probably a poor choice of words.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He began pressing forward on the subject of hacking, something the) Tj
T* (   police had not said they were going to be discussing. Anthrax felt a) Tj
T* (   little unnerved, even rattled.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Day asked if Anthrax wanted a break.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No,' he answered. `I just want to get it over and done with, if) Tj
T* (   that's OK. I'm not going to lie. I'm not going to say "no comment".) Tj
T* (   I'm going to admit to everything 'cause, based on what I have been) Tj
T* (   told, it's in my best interest to do so.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The police paused. They didn't seem to like that last comment much.) Tj
T* (   Day tried to clear things up.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Before we go any further, based on what you have been told, it is in) Tj
T* (   your best interests to tell the truth. Was it any member of the AFP) Tj
T* (   that told you this?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yes.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Who?' Day threw the question out quickly.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax couldn't remember their names. `The ones who came to my house.) Tj
T* (   I think Andrew also said it to me,' he said, nodding in the direction) Tj
T* (   of the red-headed constable.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Why were the cops getting so uncomfortable all of a sudden? It was no) Tj
T* (   secret that they had told both Anthrax and his mother repeatedly that) Tj
T* (   it was in his best interest to agree to an interview.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Day leaned forward, peered at Anthrax and asked, `What did you) Tj
T* (   interpret that to mean?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `That if I don't tell the truth, if I say "no comment" and don't) Tj
T* (   cooperate, that it is going to be ... it will mean that you will go) Tj
T* (   after me with ...' Anthrax grasped for the right words, but he felt) Tj
T* (   tongue-tied, `with ... more force, I guess.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Both officers stiffened visibly.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Day came back again. `Do you feel that an unfair inducement has been) Tj
T* (   placed on you as a result of that?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `In what sense?' The question was genuine.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `You have made the comment and it has now been recorded and I have to) Tj
T* (   clear it up. Do you feel like, that a deal has been offered to you at) Tj
T* (   any stage?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A deal? Anthrax thought about it. It wasn't a deal as in `Talk to us) Tj
T* (   now and we will make sure you don't go to jail'. Or `Talk now and we) Tj

T* (   won't beat you with a rubber hose'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No,' he answered.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Do you feel that as a result of that being said that you have been) Tj
T* (   pressured to come forward today and tell the truth?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Ah, that sort of deal. Well, of course.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yes, I have been pressured,' Anthrax answered. The two police) Tj
T* (   officers looked stunned. Anthrax paused, concerned about the growing) Tj
T* (   feeling of disapproval in the room. `Indirectly,' he added quickly,) Tj
T* (   almost apologetically.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   For a brief moment, Anthrax just didn't care. About the police. About) Tj
T* (   his father. About the pressure. He would tell the truth. He decided to) Tj
T* (   explain the situation as he saw it.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Because since they came to my house, they emphasised the fact that if) Tj
T* (   I didn't come for an interview, that they would then charge my mother) Tj
T* (   and, as my mother is very sick, I am not prepared to put her through) Tj
T* (   that.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The police looked at each other. The shock waves reverberated around) Tj
T* (   the room. The AFP clearly hadn't bargained on this coming out in the) Tj
T* (   interview tape. But what he said about his mother being threatened was) Tj
T* (   the truth, so let it be on the record with everything else.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Ken Day caught his breath, `So you are saying that you) Tj
T* (   have now been ...' he cut himself off ... `that you are not here) Tj
T* (   voluntarily?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax thought about it. What did `voluntarily' mean? The police) Tj
T* (   didn't cuff him to a chair and tell him he couldn't leave until he) Tj
T* (   talked. They didn't beat him around the head with a baton. They) Tj
T* (   offered him a choice: talk or inflict the police on his ailing mother.) Tj
T* (   Not a palatable choice, but a choice nonetheless. He chose to talk to) Tj
T* (   protect his mother.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I am here voluntarily,' he answered.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `That is not what you have said. What you have just said is) Tj
T* (   that pressure has been placed on you and that you have had to come in) Tj
T* (   here and answer the questions. Otherwise certain actions would take) Tj
T* (   place. That does not mean you are here) Tj
T* (   voluntarily.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The police must have realised they were on very thin ice and Anthrax) Tj
T* (   felt pressure growing in the room. The cops pushed. His father did not) Tj
T* (   looked pleased.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I was going to come anyway,' Anthrax answered, again almost) Tj
T* (   apologetically. Walk the tightrope, he thought. Don't get them too mad) Tj
T* (   or they will charge my mother. `You can talk to the people who carried) Tj
T* (   out the warrant. All along, I said to them I would come in for an) Tj
T* (   interview. Whatever my motivations are, I don't think should matter. I) Tj
T* (   am going to tell you the truth.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `It does matter,' Day responded, `because at the beginning of the) Tj
T* (   interview it was stated--do you agree--that you have come in here) Tj

T* (   voluntarily?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I have. No-one has forced me.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax felt exasperated. The room was getting stuffy. He wanted to) Tj
T* (   finish this thing and get out of there. So much pressure.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `And is anyone forcing you to make the answers you have given here) Tj
T* (   today?' Day tried again.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No individuals are forcing me, no.' There. You have what you want.) Tj
T* (   Now get on with it and let's get out of here.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `You have to tell the truth. Is that what you are saying?' The police) Tj
T* (   would not leave the issue be.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I want to tell the truth. As well.' The key words there were `as) Tj
T* (   well'. Anthrax thought, I want to and I have to.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `It's the circumstances that are forcing this upon you, not an) Tj
T* (   individual?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No.' Of course it was the circumstances. Never mind that the police) Tj
T* (   created the circumstance.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax felt as if the police were just toying with him. He knew and) Tj
T* (   they knew they would go after his mother if this interview wasn't to) Tj
T* (   their liking. Visions of his frail mother being hauled out of her) Tj
T* (   house by the AFP flashed through his mind. Anthrax felt sweaty and) Tj
T* (   hot. Just get on with it. Whatever makes them happy, just agree to it) Tj
T* (   in order to get out of this crowded room.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `So, would it be fair to summarise it, really, to say that perhaps ...) Tj
T* (   of your activity before the police arrived at your premises, that is) Tj
T* (   what is forcing you?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   What was this cop talking about? His `activity' forcing him? Anthrax) Tj
T* (   felt confused. The interview had already gone on some time. The cops) Tj
T* (   had such obscure ways of asking things. The room was oppressively) Tj
T* (   small.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Day pressed on with the question, `The fact that you could see you had) Tj
T* (   broken the law, and that is what is forcing you to come forward here) Tj
T* (   today and tell the truth?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Yeah. Whatever you want. `OK,' Anthrax started to answer, `That is a) Tj
T* (   fair assump--') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Day cut him off. `I just wanted to clarify that because the) Tj
T* (   interpretation I immediately got from that was that we, or members of) Tj
T* (   the AFP, had unfairly and unjustly forced you to come in here today,) Tj
T* (   and that is not the case?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Define `unfairly'. Define `unjustly'. Anthrax thought it was unfair) Tj
T* (   the cops might charge his mother. But they told her it was perfectly) Tj
T* (   legal to do so. Anthrax felt light-headed. All these thoughts whirring) Tj
T* (   around inside his head.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No, that is not the case. I'm sorry for ...' Be humble. Get out of) Tj
T* (   that room faster.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No, that is OK. If that is what you believe, say it. I have no) Tj
T* (   problems with that. I just like to have it clarified. Remember, other) Tj
T* (   people might listen to this tape and they will draw inferences and) Tj
T* (   opinions from it. At any point where I think there is an ambiguity, I) Tj
T* (   will ask for clarification. Do you understand that?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yes. I understand.' Anthrax couldn't really focus on what Day was) Tj
T* (   saying. He was feeling very distressed and just wanted to finish the) Tj
T* (   interview.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The cops finally moved on, but the new topic was almost as unpleasant.) Tj
T* (   Day began probing about Anthrax's earlier hacking career--the one he) Tj
T* (   had no intention of talking about. Anthrax began to feel a bit better.) Tj
T* (   He agreed to talk to the police about recent phreaking activities, not) Tj
T* (   hacking matters. Indeed, he had repeatedly told them that topic was) Tj
T* (   not on his agenda. He felt like he was standing on firmer ground.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   After being politely stonewalled, Day circled around and tried again.) Tj
T* (   `OK. I will give you another allegation; that you have unlawfully) Tj
T* (   accessed computer systems in Australia and the United States. In the) Tj
T* (   US, you specifically targeted military computer systems. Do you) Tj
T* (   understand that allegation?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I understand that. I wouldn't like to comment on it.' No, sir. No) Tj
T* (   way.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Day tried a new tack. `I will further allege that you did work with a) Tj
T* (   person known as Mendax.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   What on earth was Day talking about? Anthrax had heard of Mendax, but) Tj
T* (   they had never worked together. He thought the cops must not have very) Tj
T* (   good informants.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No. That is not true. I know no-one of that name.' Not strictly true,) Tj
T* (   but true enough.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Well, if he was to turn around to me and say that you were doing all) Tj
T* (   this hacking, he would be lying, would he?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Oh wonderful. Some other hacker was crapping on to the cops with lies) Tj
T* (   about how he and Anthrax had worked together. That was exactly why) Tj
T* (   Anthrax didn't work in a group. He had plenty of real allegations to) Tj
T* (   fend off. He didn't need imaginary ones too.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Most certainly would. Unless he goes by some other name, I know) Tj
T* (   no-one by that name, Mendax.' Kill that off quick.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In fact Mendax had not ratted on Anthrax at all. That was just a) Tj
T* (   technique the police used.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `You don't wish to comment on the fact that you have hacked into other) Tj
T* (   computer systems and military systems?' If there) Tj
T* (   was one thing Anthrax could say for Day, it was that he was) Tj
T* (   persistent.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `No. I would prefer not to comment on any of that. This is the advice) Tj
T* (   I have received: not to comment on anything unrelated to the topic) Tj
T* (   that I was told I would be talking about when I came down here.') Tj

T* (   `All right, well are you going to answer any questions in relation to) Tj
T* (   unlawfully accessing any computer systems?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Based upon the legal advice that I received, I choose not to.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Day pursed his lips. `All right. If that is your attitude and you) Tj
T* (   don't wish to answer any of those questions, we won't pursue the) Tj
T* (   matter. However, I will inform you now that the matter may be reported) Tj
T* (   and you may receive a summons to answer the questions or face charges) Tj
T* (   in relation to those allegations, and, at any time that you so choose,) Tj
T* (   you can come forward and tell us the truth.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Woah. Anthrax took a deep breath. Could the cops make him come answer) Tj
T* (   questions with a summons? They were changing the game midway through.) Tj
T* (   Anthrax felt as though the carpet had been pulled out from beneath his) Tj
T* (   feet. He needed a few minutes to clear his head.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Is it something I can think over and discuss?' Anthrax asked.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Yes. Do you want to have a pause and a talk with your father? The) Tj
T* (   constable and I can step out of the room, or offer you another room.) Tj
T* (   You may wish to have a break and think about it if you like. I think) Tj
T* (   it might be a good idea. I think we might have a ten-minute break and) Tj
T* (   put you in another room and let you two have a chat about it. There is) Tj
T* (   no pressure.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Day and the Sexton stopped the interview and guided father and son) Tj
T* (   into another room. Once they were alone, Anthrax looked to his father) Tj
T* (   for support. This voice inside him still cried out to keep away from) Tj
T* (   his earlier hacking journeys. He needed someone to tell him the same) Tj
T* (   thing.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   His father was definitely not that someone. He railed against Anthrax) Tj
T* (   with considerable vehemence. Stop holding back. You have to tell) Tj
T* (   everything. How could you be so stupid? You can't fool the police.) Tj
T* (   They know. Confess it all before it's too late. At the end of the) Tj
T* (   ten-minute tirade, Anthrax felt worse than he had at the beginning.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When the two returned to the interview room, Anthrax's father turned) Tj
T* (   to the police and said suddenly, `He has decided to confess'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   That was not true. Anthrax hadn't decided anything of the sort. His) Tj
T* (   father was full of surprises. It seemed every time he opened his) Tj
T* (   mouth, an ugly surprise came out.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Ken Day and Andrew Sexton warmed up a shaky Anthrax by showing him) Tj
T* (   various documents, pieces of paper with Anthrax's scribbles seized) Tj
T* (   during the raid, telephone taps. At one stage, Day pointed to some) Tj
T* (   handwritten notes which read `KDAY'. He looked at Anthrax.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `What's that? That's me.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax smiled for the first time in a long while. It was something to) Tj
T* (   be happy about. The head of the AFP's Computer Crime Unit in Melbourne) Tj
T* (   sat there, so sure he was onto something big. There was his name, bold) Tj
T* (   as day, in the hacker's handwriting on a bit of paper seized in a) Tj
T* (   raid. Day seemed to be expecting something good.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax said, `If you ring that up you will find it is a radio) Tj
T* (   station.' An American radio station. Written on the same bit of paper) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `There you go,' Day laughed at his own hasty conclusions. `I've got a) Tj
T* (   radio station named after me.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Day asked Anthrax why he wrote down all sorts of things, directory) Tj
T* (   paths, codes, error messages.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Just part of the record-keeping. I think I wrote this down when I had) Tj

T* (   into the next one and the next one and the next one, after a while it) Tj

T* (   explanation.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Once you have tasted the forbidden fruit?') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Exactly. It's a good analogy.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Day pressed on with questions about Anthrax's hacking. He successfully) Tj
T* (   elicited admissions from the hacker. Anthrax gave Day more than the) Tj
T* (   police officer had before, but probably not as much as he would have) Tj
T* (   liked.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It was, however, enough. Enough to keep the police from charging) Tj
T* (   Anthrax's mother. And enough for them to charge him.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax didn't see his final list of charges until the day he appeared) Tj
T* (   in court on 28 August 1995. The whole case seemed to be a bit) Tj
T* (   disorganised. His Legal Aid lawyer had little knowledge of computers,) Tj
T* (   let alone computer crime. He told Anthrax he could ask for an) Tj
T* (   adjournment because he hadn't seen the final charges until so late,) Tj
T* (   but Anthrax wanted to get the thing over and done with. They had) Tj
T* (   agreed that Anthrax would plead guilty to the charges and hope for a) Tj
T* (   reasonable magistrate.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax looked through the hand-up brief provided by the prosecution,) Tj
T* (   which included a heavily edited transcript of his interview with the) Tj
T* (   police. It was labelled as a `summary', but it certainly didn't) Tj
T* (   summarise everything important in that interview. Either the) Tj
T* (   prosecution or the police had cut out all references to the fact that) Tj
T* (   the police had threatened to charge Anthrax's mother if he didn't) Tj
T* (   agree to be interviewed.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax pondered the matter. Wasn't everything relevant to his case) Tj
T* (   supposed to be covered in a hand-up brief? This seemed very relevant) Tj

T* (   document. He began to wonder if the police had edited down the) Tj
T* (   transcript just so they could cut out that portion of the interview.) Tj
T* (   Perhaps the judge wouldn't be too happy about it. He thought that) Tj
T* (   maybe the police didn't want to be held accountable for how they had) Tj
T* (   dealt with his mother.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The rest of the hand-up brief wasn't much better. The only statement) Tj
T* (   by an actual `witness' to Anthrax's hacking was from his former) Tj
T* (   room-mate, who claimed that he had watched Anthrax break into a NASA) Tj
T* (   computer and access an `area of the computer system which showed the) Tj
T* (   latitude/longitude of ships'.) Tj

T* (   know. And he had certainly never broken into a NASA computer in front) Tj
T* (   of the room-mate. It was absurd. This guy is lying, Anthrax thought,) Tj
T* (   and five minutes under cross-examination by a reasonable lawyer would) Tj
T* (   illustrate as much. Anthrax's instincts told him the prosecution had a) Tj
T* (   flimsy case for some of the charges, but he felt overwhelmed by) Tj
T* (   pressure from all sides--his family, the bustle in the courtroom, even) Tj

T* (   there was a family presence. Anthrax gave the suggestion a cool) Tj

T* (   Anthrax's mother was back at his apartment, waiting for news. She had) Tj
T* (   been on night duty and was supposed to be sleeping. That was the) Tj
T* (   ostensible reason she didn't attend. Anthrax thought perhaps that the) Tj
T* (   tension was too much for her. Whatever the reason, she didn't sleep) Tj
T* (   all that day. She tidied the place, washed the dishes, did the) Tj
T* (   laundry, and kept herself as busy as the tiny apartment would allow) Tj
T* (   her.) Tj

T* (   children, mostly girls, chatted in the rows behind her.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   convictions. But the snowball had been set in motion. The magistrate) Tj
T* (   appeared and opened the court.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax felt he couldn't back out now and he pleaded guilty to 21) Tj
T* (   counts, including one charge of inserting data and twenty charges of) Tj
T* (   defrauding or attempting to defraud a carrier.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   His lawyer put the case for a lenient sentence. He called Anthrax's) Tj
T* (   father up on the stand and asked him questions about his son. His) Tj
T* (   father probably did more harm than good. When asked if he thought his) Tj
T* (   son would offend again, his father replied, `I don't know'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax was livid. It was further unconscionable behaviour. Not long) Tj
T* (   before the trial, Anthrax had discovered that his father had planned) Tj
T* (   to sneak out of the country two days before the court case. He was) Tj
T* (   going overseas, he told his wife, but not until after the court case.) Tj
T* (   It was only by chance that she discovered his surreptitious plans to) Tj
T* (   leave early. Presumably he would find his son's trial humiliating.) Tj
T* (   Anthrax's mother insisted he stayed and he begrudgingly delayed the) Tj
T* (   trip.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   His father sat down, a bit away from Anthrax and his lawyer. The) Tj
T* (   lawyer provided a colourful alternative to the prosecutor. He perched) Tj
T* (   one leg up on his bench, rested an elbow on the knee and stroked his) Tj
T* (   long, red beard. It was an impressive beard, more than a foot long and) Tj
T* (   thick with reddish brown curls. Somehow it fitted with his two-tone) Tj
T* (   chocolate brown suit and his tie, a breathtakingly wide creation with) Tj
T* (   wild patterns in gold. The suit was one size too small. He launched) Tj
T* (   into the usual courtroom flourish--lots of words saying nothing. Then) Tj
T* (   he got to the punch line.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Your worship, this young man has been in all sorts of places. NASA,) Tj
T* (   military sites, you wouldn't believe some of the places he has been.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `I don't think I want to know where he has been,' the magistrate) Tj
T* (   answered wryly.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The strategy was Anthrax's. He thought he could turn a) Tj
T* (   liability into an asset by showing that he had been in many) Tj
T* (   systems--many sensitive systems--but had done no malicious damage in) Tj
T* (   any of them.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The strategy worked and the magistrate announced there was no way he) Tj
T* (   was sending the young hacker to jail.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The prosecutor looked genuinely disappointed and launched a counter) Tj
T* (   proposal--1500 hours of community service. Anthrax caught his breath.) Tj
T* (   That was absurd. It would take almost nine months, full time. Painting) Tj
T* (   buildings, cleaning toilets. Forget about his university studies. It was) Tj
T* (   almost as bad as prison.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Anthrax's lawyer protested. `Your Worship, that penalty is something) Tj
T* (   out of cyberspace.' Anthrax winced at how corny that sounded, but the) Tj
T* (   lawyer looked very pleased with himself.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The magistrate refused to have a bar of the prosecutor's counter) Tj
T* (   proposal. Anthrax's girlfriend was impressed with the magistrate. She) Tj
T* (   didn't know much about the law or the court system, but he seemed a) Tj
T* (   fair man, a just man. He didn't appear to want to give a harsh) Tj
T* (   punishment to Anthrax at all. But he told the court he had to send a) Tj

T* (   The magistrate announced his sentence. Two hundred hours of community) Tj

T* (   These weren't the only interesting people at the con. I met up with an) Tj
T* (   older group of nonconformists in the computer industry, a sort of) Tj
T* (   Austin intelligentsia. By older, I mean above the age of 26. They were) Tj
T* (   interested in many of the same issues as the young group of) Tj

T* (   all had technical backgrounds.) Tj

T* (   This loose group of blue-jean clad thinkers, people like Doug Barnes,) Tj
T* (   Jeremy Porter and Jim McCoy, like to meet over enchiladas and) Tj
T* (   margueritas at university-style cafes. They always seemed to have) Tj
T* (   three or four projects on the run. Digital cash was the flavour of the) Tj
T* (   month when I met them. They were unconventional, perhaps even a little) Tj
T* (   weird, but they were also bright, very creative and highly innovative.) Tj
T* (   They were just the sort of people who might marry creative ideas with) Tj
T* (   maturity and business sense, eventually making widespread digital cash) Tj

T* (   would be surprised if any of them continued hacking.) Tj

T* (   Most of them, however, are not sorry for their hacking activities.) Tj
T* (   Some are sorry they upset people. They feel badly that they caused) Tj

T* (   how he believed the AFP had behaved inappropriately throughout his) Tj

T* (   with threats and had harassed him, taken photographs of him without) Tj
T* (   his permission, given information to his university about his case) Tj
T* (   prior to the issue of a summons and the resolution of his case, and) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In 1995-96, a total of 1157 complaints were filed against the AFP, 683) Tj

T* (   substantiated. Another 9 per cent were deemed to be `incapable of) Tj

T* (   The AFP's internal investigation concluded that Anthrax's complaints) Tj

T* (   secure it properly in the first place, the two British hackers) Tj
T* (   rejected security gurus who refused to tell the world about new) Tj
T* (   security holes. Their 8lgm advisories began marginalising the) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad doesn't hack any more. The reason isn't the risk of getting caught) Tj
T* (   or the threat of prison. He has stopped hacking because he has) Tj
T* (   realised what a headache it is for a system administrator to clean up) Tj
T* (   his or her computer after an attack. Searching through logs. Looking) Tj
T* (   for backdoors the hacker might have left behind. The hours, the) Tj
T* (   hassle, the pressure--he thinks it is wrong to put anyone through) Tj
T* (   that. Pad understands far better now how much strain a hacker) Tj
T* (   intrusion can cause another human being.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   There is another reason Pad has given up hacking: he has simply) Tj
T* (   outgrown the desire. He says that he has better things to do with his) Tj
T* (   time. Computers are a way for him to earn a living, not a way to spend) Tj
T* (   his leisure time. After a trip overseas he decided that real) Tj
T* (   travel--not its electronic cousin--was more interesting than hacking.) Tj
T* (   He has also learned to play the guitar, something he believes he would) Tj
T* (   have done years ago if he hadn't spent so much time hacking.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Gandalf shares Pad's interest in travelling. One reason they like) Tj
T* (   contract work is because it lets them work hard for six months, save) Tj
T* (   some money, and then take a few months off. The aim of both ex-hackers) Tj
T* (   for now is simply to sling backpacks over their shoulders and bounce) Tj
T* (   around the globe.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Pad still thinks that Britain takes hacking far too seriously and he) Tj
T* (   is considering moving overseas permanently. The 8lgm court case made) Tj
T* (   him wonder about the people in power in Britain--the politicians, the) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The Ombudsman concluded that Warren and Cosgriff's relationship with) Tj

T* (   `Whilst Mr Gill may have had his own agenda and taken advantage of his) Tj

T* (   disturbing scene. Phoenix was sprawled across the road. His helmet had) Tj
T* (   a huge crack on the side, where his head had hit the car's petrol) Tj
T* (   tank, and petrol had spilled over the motorcycle and its rider.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Miraculously, Phoenix was unhurt, though very dazed. Some bystanders) Tj
T* (   helped him and the distraught driver to a nearby halfway house. They) Tj
T* (   called an ambulance, and then made the two traumatised young men some) Tj
T* (   tea in the kitchen. Phoenix's mother arrived, called by a bystander at) Tj
T* (   Phoenix's request. The ambulance workers confirmed that Phoenix had) Tj
T* (   not broken any bones but they recommended he go to hospital to check) Tj
T* (   for possible concussion.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Still both badly shaken, Phoenix and the driver exchanged names and) Tj
T* (   phone numbers. Phoenix told the driver he did technical work for a) Tj
T* (   0055 telephone service, then said, `You might recognise me. I'm) Tj
T* (   Phoenix. There's this big computer hacking case going on in) Tj

T* (   But the next generation of elite hackers and phreakers have heard a) Tj
T* (   very different message, a message which says: Don't get caught.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The principle of deterrence has not worked with hackers at this level.) Tj
T* (   I'm not talking here about the codes-kids--the teeny-bopper, carding,) Tj
T* (   wanna-be nappies who hang out on IRC \(Internet relay chat\). I'm) Tj
T* (   talking about the elite hackers. If anything, law enforcement) Tj
T* (   crackdowns have not only pushed them further underground, they have) Tj
T* (   encouraged hackers to become more sophisticated than ever before in) Tj
T* (   the way they protect themselves. Adversity is the mother of invention.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When police officers march through the front door of a hacker's home) Tj
T* (   today, they may be better prepared than their predecessors, but they) Tj
T* (   will also be facing bigger hurdles.  Today, top hackers encrypt) Tj
T* (   everything sensitive. The data on their hard drives, their live data) Tj
T* (   connections, even their voice conversations.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   So, if hackers are still hacking, who are their targets?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   It is a broad field. Any type of network provider--X.25, cellular) Tj
T* (   phone or large Internet provider. Computer vendors--the manufacturers) Tj
T* (   of software and hardware, routers, gateways, firewalls or phone) Tj
T* (   switches. Military institutions, governments and banks seem to be a) Tj
T* (   little less fashionable these days, though there are still plenty of) Tj
T* (   attacks on these sorts of sites.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Attacks on security experts are still common, but a new trend is the) Tj
T* (   increase in attacks on other hackers' systems. One Australian hacker) Tj
T* (   joked, `What are the other hackers going to do? Call the Feds? Tell) Tj
T* (   the AFP, "Yes, officer, that's right, some computer criminal broke) Tj
T* (   into my machine and stole 20000 passwords and all my exploitation code) Tj
T* (   for bypassing firewalls".') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   For the most part, elite hackers seem to work alone, because of the) Tj
T* (   well-advertised risks of getting caught. There are still some) Tj
T* (   underground hacking communities frequented by top hackers, most notably) Tj
T* (   UPT in Canada and a few groups like the l0pht in the US, but such groups) Tj
T* (   are far less common, and more fragmented than they used to be.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   These hackers have reached a new level of sophistication, not just in) Tj
T* (   the technical nature of their attacks, but in their strategies and) Tj
T* (   objectives. Once, top hackers such as Electron and Phoenix were happy) Tj
T* (   to get copies of Zardoz, which listed security holes found by industry) Tj
T* (   experts. Now top hackers find those holes themselves--by reading line) Tj
T* (   by line through the proprietary source code from places like DEC, HP,) Tj
T* (   CISCO, Sun and Microsoft.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Industrial espionage does not seem to be on the agenda, at least with) Tj
T* (   anyone I interviewed. I have yet to meet a hacker who has given) Tj
T* (   proprietary source code to a vendor's competitor. I have, however, met) Tj
T* (   a hacker who found one company's proprietary source code inside the) Tj
T* (   computer of its competitor. Was that a legal copy of the source code?) Tj

T* (   the teacher a message without actually jacking up in class.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He got into hacking after reading a magazine article about people who) Tj
T* (   hacked answering machines and VMBs. At that time, he had no idea what) Tj
T* (   a VMB was, but he learned fast. One Sunday evening, he sat down with) Tj
T* (   his phone and began scanning. Soon he was into phreaking, and visiting) Tj
T* (   English-speaking party lines. Somehow, he always felt more comfortable) Tj
T* (   speaking in English, to native English-speakers, perhaps because he) Tj
T* (   felt a little like an outsider in his own culture.) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   What made him want to hack or phreak in the first place? Maybe it was) Tj
T* (   the desire to screw over the universally hated phone company, or) Tj
T* (   `possibly the sheer lust for power' or then again, maybe he was simply) Tj
T* (   answering his desire `to explore an intricate piece of technology'.) Tj
T* (   Today, however, he is a little clearer on why he continues to hack.) Tj
T* (   `My first and foremost motivation is to learn,' he said.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   When asked why he doesn't visit his local university or library to) Tj
T* (   satisfy that desire, he answered, `in books, you only learn theory. It) Tj
T* (   is not that I dislike the theory but computer security in real life is) Tj
T* (   much different from theory'. Libraries also have trouble keeping pace) Tj
T* (   with the rate of technological change, SKiMo said. `Possibly, it is) Tj
T* (   also just the satisfaction of knowing that what I learn is) Tj
T* (   proprietary--is "inside knowledge",' he added. There could, he said,) Tj
T* (   be some truth in the statement that he likes learning in an) Tj
T* (   adrenalin-inducing environment.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Is he addicted to computers? SKiMo says no, but the indications are) Tj
T* (   there. By his own estimate, he has hacked between 3000 and 10000) Tj
T* (   computers in total. His parents--who have no idea what their son was) Tj
T* (   up to day and night on his computer--worry about his behaviour. They) Tj

T* (   After carefully researching and probing a site, SKiMo unearthed a) Tj
T* (   method of capturing the encryption keys generated for DeTeMobil's) Tj
T* (   mobile phone conversations.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He explained: `The keys are not fixed, in the sense that they are) Tj
T* (   generated once and then stored in some database. Rather, a key is) Tj
T* (   generated for each phone conversation by the company's AUC) Tj
T* (   [authentication centre], using the "Ki" and a random value generated) Tj
T* (   by the AUC. The Ki is the secret key that is securely stored on the) Tj
T* (   smart card [inside the cellphone], and a copy is also stored in the) Tj
T* (   AUC. When the AUC "tells" the cellphone the key for that particular) Tj
T* (   conversation, the information passes through the company's MSC [mobile) Tj
T* (   switching centre].) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `It is possible to eavesdrop on a certain cellphone if one actively) Tj
T* (   monitors either the handovers or the connection set-up messages from) Tj
T* (   the OMC [operations and maintenance centre] or if one knows the Ki in) Tj
T* (   the smart card.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Both options are entirely possible. The first option, which relies on) Tj
T* (   knowing the A5 encryption key, requires the right equipment. The) Tj
T* (   second option, using the Ki, means you have to know the A3/A8) Tj
T* (   algorithms as well or the Ki is useless. These algorithms can be) Tj

T* (   The customer doesn't even have to be talking on the mobile. All he has) Tj
T* (   to do is have the phone turned on, waiting to receive calls.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   SKiMo tracked one customer for an afternoon, as the man travelled) Tj
T* (   across Germany, then called the customer up. It turned out they spoke) Tj
T* (   the same European language.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   `Why are you driving from Hamburg to Bremen with your phone on) Tj
T* (   stand-by mode?' SKiMo asked.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The customer freaked out. How did this stranger at the end of the) Tj
T* (   phone know where he had been travelling?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   SKiMo said he was from Greenpeace. `Don't drive around so much. It) Tj
T* (   creates pollution,' he told the bewildered mobile customer. Then he) Tj
T* (   told the customer about the importance of conserving energy and how) Tj
T* (   prolonged used of mobile phones affected certain parts of one's brain.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Originally, SKiMo broke into the mobile phone carriers' network) Tj
T* (   because he wanted `to go completely cellular'--a transition which he) Tj
T* (   hoped would make him both mobile and much harder to trace. Being able) Tj
T* (   to eavesdrop on other people's calls-- including those of the) Tj
T* (   police--was going to be a bonus.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   However, as he pursued this project, he discovered that the code from) Tj
T* (   a mobile phone manufacturer which he needed to study was `a) Tj
T* (   multi-lingual project'. `I don't know whether you have ever seen a) Tj
T* (   multi-lingual project,' SKiMo says, `where nobody defines a common) Tj
T* (   language that all programmers must use for their comments and function) Tj
T* (   names? They look horrible. They are no fun to read.' Part of this one) Tj
T* (   was in Finnish.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   SKiMo says he has hacked a number of major vendors and, in several) Tj
T* (   cases, has had access to their products' source codes.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Has he had the access to install backdoors in primary source code for) Tj
T* (   major vendors? Yes. Has he done it? He says no. On other hand, I asked) Tj
T* (   him who he would tell if he did do it. `No-one,' he said, `because) Tj
T* (   there is more risk if two people know than if one does.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   SKiMo is mostly a loner these days. He shares a limited amount of) Tj
T* (   information about hacking exploits with two people, but the) Tj
T* (   conversations are usually carefully worded or vague. He substitutes a) Tj
T* (   different vendor's names for the real one, or he discusses technical) Tj
T* (   computer security issues in an in-depth but theoretical manner, so he) Tj
T* (   doesn't have to name any particular system.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   He doesn't talk about anything to do with hacking on the telephone.) Tj
T* (   Mostly, when he manages to capture a particularly juicy prize, he) Tj
T* (   keeps news of his latest conquest to himself.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj

T* (   could ask for certain things--such as technical advice,' SKiMo said.) Tj
T* (   `Now I find it much easier to get that info myself than asking anyone) Tj
T* (   for it. I look at the source code, then experiment and discover new) Tj

T* (   for people who don't want to learn everything.') Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   SKiMo can't see himself giving up hacking any time in the near future.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Who is on the other side these days?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   In Australia, it is still the Australian Federal Police, although the) Tj
T* (   agency has come a long way since the early days of the Computer Crimes) Tj
T* (   Unit. When AFP officers burst in on Phoenix, Nom and Electron, they) Tj
T* (   were like the Keystone Cops. The police were no match for the) Tj
T* (   Australian hackers in the subsequent interviews. The hackers were so) Tj
T* (   far out in front in technical knowledge it was laughable.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The AFP has been closing that gap with considerable alacrity. Under) Tj
T* (   the guidance of officers like Ken Day, they now run a more technically) Tj
T* (   skilled group of law enforcement officers. In 1995-96, the AFP had) Tj
T* (   about 2800 employees, although some 800 of these worked in `community) Tj
T* (   policing'--serving as the local police in places like the ACT and) Tj
T* (   Norfolk Island. The AFP's annual expenditure was about $270 million in) Tj
T* (   that year.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As an institution, the AFP has recently gone through a major) Tj
T* (   reorganisation, designed to make it less of a command-and-control) Tj
T* (   military structure and more of an innovative, service oriented) Tj
T* (   organisation.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Some of these changes are cosmetic. AFP officers are now no longer) Tj
T* (   called `constable' or `detective sergeant'--they are all just `federal) Tj
T* (   agents'. The AFP now has a `vision' which is `to fight crime and) Tj
T* (   win'.3 Its organisational chart had been transformed from a) Tj
T* (   traditional, hierarchical pyramid of square boxes into a collection of) Tj
T* (   little circles linked to bigger circles--all in a circle shape. No) Tj
T* (   phallo-centric structures here. You can tell the politically correct) Tj
T* (   management consultants have been visiting the AFP.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The AFP has, however, also changed in more substantive ways. There are) Tj
T* (   now `teams' with different expertise, and AFP investigators can draw) Tj
T* (   on them on an as-needed basis. In terms of increased efficiency, this) Tj
T* (   fluidity is probably a good thing.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   There are about five permanent officers in the Melbourne computer) Tj
T* (   crimes area. Although the AFP doesn't release detailed budget) Tj
T* (   breakdowns, my back-of-the-envelope analysis suggested that the AFP) Tj
T* (   spends less than $1 million per year on the Melbourne computer crimes) Tj
T* (   area in total. Sydney also has a Computer Crimes Unit.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Catching hackers and phreakers is only one part of the unit's job.) Tj
T* (   Another important task is to provide technical computer expertise for) Tj
T* (   other investigations.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Day still runs the show in Melbourne. He doesn't think or act like a) Tj
T* (   street cop. He is a psychological player, and therefore well suited to) Tj
T* (   his opponents. According to a reliable source outside the underground,) Tj
T* (   he is also a clean cop, a competent officer, and `a nice guy'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   However, being the head of the Computer Crimes Unit for so many years) Tj
T* (   makes Day an easy target in the underground. In particular, hackers) Tj

T* (   game. It's a criminal act'.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   To hackers watching the show, this was a matter of opinion. Not long) Tj
T* (   after the episode went to air, a few members of Neuro-cactus, an) Tj
T* (   Australian group of hackers and phreakers which had its roots in) Tj
T* (   Western Australia, decided to take the mickey out of Day. Two members,) Tj

T* (   someone who is working on getting Day's home number'. The word is that) Tj
T* (   a few members of the underground already have the information and have) Tj
T* (   used it. Some people think it would be hilarious to call up Day at) Tj
T* (   home and prank him. Frankly, I feel a bit sorry for the guy. You can) Tj
T* (   bet the folks in traffic operations don't have to put up with this) Tj
T* (   stuff.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   But that doesn't mean I think these pranksters should be locked up) Tj
T* (   either.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   If we, as a society, choose not to lock hackers up, then what should) Tj
T* (   we do with them?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Perhaps a better question is, do we really need to do anything with) Tj
T* (   them?) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   One answer is to simply ignore look-see hacking. Society could decide) Tj
T* (   that it makes more sense to use valuable police resources to catch) Tj
T* (   dangerous criminals--forgers, embezzlers, white-collar swindlers,) Tj
T* (   corporate spies and malicious hackers--than to chase look-see hackers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The law must still maintain the capacity to punish hard where someone) Tj
T* (   has strayed into what society deems serious crime. However, almost any) Tj
T* (   serious crime committed by a hacker could be committed by a non-hacker) Tj
T* (   and prosecuted under other legislation. Fraud, wilful damage and) Tj
T* (   dealing in stolen property are crimes regardless of the medium--and) Tj
T* (   should be punished appropriately.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Does it make sense to view most look-see hackers--and by that I mean) Tj
T* (   hackers who do not do malicious damage or commit fraud--as criminals?) Tj
T* (   Probably not. They are primarily just a nuisance and should be treated) Tj
T* (   as such. This would not be difficult to do. The law-makers could) Tj
T* (   simply declare look-see hacking to be a minor legal infringement. In) Tj
T* (   the worst-case scenario, a repeat offender might have to do a little) Tj
T* (   community service. But such community service needs to be managed) Tj
T* (   properly. In one Australian case, a corrections officer assigned a) Tj
T* (   hacker to dig ditches with a convicted rapist and murderer.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Many hackers have never had a job--in part because of the high youth) Tj
T* (   unemployment in some areas--and so their community service might be) Tj
T* (   their first `position'. The right community service placement must) Tj
T* (   involve hackers using their computer skills to give something back to) Tj
T* (   society, preferably in some sort of autonomous, creative project. A) Tj

T* (   In practice, most Australia's judges have been reasonably fair in) Tj
T* (   their sentencing, certainly compared to judges overseas. None of the) Tj
T* (   Australian hackers detailed in this work received a prison sentence.) Tj
T* (   Part of this is due to happenstance, but part is also due to the sound) Tj
T* (   judgments of people like Judge Lewis and Judge Kimm. It must be very) Tj

T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As I sat in court listening to each judge, it quickly became clear) Tj
T* (   that these judges had done their homework. With psychologist Tim) Tj
T* (   Watson-Munro on the stand, Judge Lewis rapidly zeroed in on the) Tj
T* (   subject of `free will'--as applied to addiction--regarding Prime) Tj
T* (   Suspect. In Trax's case, Judge Kimm asked pointed questions which he) Tj
T* (   could only have formulated after serious study of the extensive legal) Tj
T* (   brief. Their well-informed judgments suggested a deeper understanding) Tj
T* (   both of hacking as a crime, and of the intent of the largely untested) Tj
T* (   computer crime legislation.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   However, a great deal of time and money has been wasted in the pursuit) Tj
T* (   of look-see hackers, largely because this sort of hacking is treated) Tj
T* (   as a major crime. Consider the following absurd situation created by) Tj
T* (   Australia's federal computer criminal legislation.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   A spy breaks into a computer at the Liberal Party's headquarters and) Tj
T* (   reads the party's top-secret election strategy, which he may want to) Tj
T* (   pass on to the Labor Party. He doesn't insert or delete any data in) Tj
T* (   the process, or view any commercial information. The penalty under) Tj
T* (   this legislation? A maximum of six months in prison.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   That same spy decides he wants to get rich quick. Using the local) Tj
T* (   telephone system, he hacks into a bank's computer with the intention) Tj
T* (   of defrauding the financial institution. He doesn't view any) Tj
T* (   commercial or personal information, or delete or insert any files. Yet) Tj
T* (   the information he reviews--about the layout of a bank building, or) Tj
T* (   how to set off its fire alarm or sprinkler system--proves vital in his) Tj
T* (   plan to defraud the bank. His penalty: a maximum of two years prison.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Our spy now moves onto bigger and better things. He penetrates a) Tj
T* (   Department of Defence computer with the intention of obtaining) Tj
T* (   information about Australia's military strategies and passing it on to) Tj
T* (   the Malaysians. Again, he doesn't delete or insert any data--he just) Tj
T* (   reads every sensitive planning document he can find. Under the federal) Tj
T* (   anti-hacking laws, the maximum penalty he would receive would also be) Tj
T* (   two years prison.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Meanwhile, a look-see hacker breaks into a university computer without) Tj
T* (   doing any damage. He doesn't delete any files. He FTPs a public-domain) Tj
T* (   file from another system and quietly tucks it away in a hidden, unused) Tj
T* (   corner of the university machine. Maybe he writes a message to someone) Tj
T* (   else on-line. If caught, the law, as interpreted by the AFP and the) Tj

T* (   DPP, says he faces up to ten years in prison. The reason? He has) Tj
T* (   inserted or deleted data.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Although the spy hacker might also face other charges--such as) Tj
T* (   treason--this exercise illustrates some of the problems with the) Tj
T* (   current computer crime legislation.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   The letter of the law says that our look-see hacker might face a) Tj
T* (   prison term five times greater than the bank fraud criminal or the) Tj
T* (   military spy, and twenty times greater than the anti-Liberal Party) Tj
T* (   subversive, if he inserts or deletes any data. The law, as interpreted) Tj
T* (   by the AFP, says that the look-see hacking described above should have) Tj
T* (   the same maximum ten-year prison penalty as judicial corruption. It's) Tj
T* (   a weird mental image--the corrupt judge and the look-see hacker) Tj
T* (   sharing a prison cell.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Although the law-makers may not have fully understood the) Tj
T* (   technological aspects of hacking when they introduced the computer) Tj
T* (   crimes legislation, their intent seems clear. They were trying to) Tj
T* (   differentiate between a malicious hacker and a look-see hacker, but) Tj
T* (   they could have worded it better.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   As it's worded, the legislation puts malicious, destructive hacking on) Tj
T* (   a par with look-see hacking by saying that anyone who destroys,) Tj
T* (   erases, alters or inserts data via a carrier faces a prison term,) Tj
T* (   regardless of the person's intent. There is no gradation in the law) Tj
T* (   between mere deletion of data and `aggravated deletion'--the maximum) Tj
T* (   penalty is ten years for both. The AFP has taken advantage of this) Tj
T* (   lack of distinction, and the result has been a steady stream of) Tj
T* (   look-see hackers being charged with the most serious computer crime) Tj
T* (   offences.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Parliament makes the laws. Government institutions such as the AFP,) Tj
T* (   the DPP and the courts interpret and apply those laws. The AFP and to) Tj
T* (   some extent the DPP have applied the strict letter of the law) Tj
T* (   correctly in most of the hacking cases described in this book. They) Tj
T* (   have, however, missed the intention of the law. Change the law and) Tj
T* (   they may behave differently. Make look-see hacking a minor offence and) Tj
T* (   the institutions will stop going after the soft targets and hopefully) Tj
T* (   spend more time on the real criminals.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   I have seen some of these hackers up close, studied them for two years) Tj
T* (   and learned a bit about what makes them tick. In many ways, they are) Tj
T* (   quintessentially Australian, always questioning authority and) Tj
T* (   rebelling against `the establishment'. They're smart--in some cases) Tj
T* (   very smart. A few might even be classified as technical geniuses.) Tj
T* (   They're mischievous, but also very enterprising. They're rebels,) Tj
T* (   public nuisances and dreamers.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   Most of all, they know how to think outside the box.) Tj
T* (   ) Tj
T* (   This is not a flaw. Often, it is a very valuable trait--and one which) Tj
T* (   pushes society forward into new frontiers. The question shouldn't be) Tj
T* (   whether we want to crush it but how we should steer it in a different) Tj
T* (   direction.) Tj
